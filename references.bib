  abstract  = {Field surveys in the 724-km2 Queets river basin on the west slope of the Olympic Mountains in \{NW\} Washington reveal basin-wide patterns of distinctive wood debris (WD) accumulations that arise from different mechanisms of \{WD\} recruitment, hydraulic geometry, and physical characteristics of WD. Individual pieces of \{WD\} in an accumulation or jam can be separated into key, racked, and loose members. Ten types of \{WD\} accumulations are identified based on the mode of recruitment and the orientation of key, racked, and loose debris relative to the channel axis. Although some types of \{WD\} accumulation have few geomorphic effects, others form stable in-stream structures that influence alluvial morphology at both subreach- and reach-length scales ranging from less than 1 to greater than 10 channel widths. In the Queets river, stable accumulations of \{WD\} directly influence channel anabranching, planform geometry, flood plain topography, and establishment of long-term riparian refugia for old-growth forest development. The classification of wood debris accumulations in the Queets river basin is based on physical observations that offer a template potentially applicable to other forested mountain regions.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Sediment transport processes in rivers continue to pose a challenge when designing movable-bed physical models, particularly for reproducing the grain sorting and bank erosion (fluvial erosion and mass failure). This paper presents and discusses scale effects of a specific scaling approach for multi-grain size mixtures that preserves similarity of initial motion for each grain size class and of the bank stability coefficient between the model and the prototype, but relaxes strict similarity of the Shields and particle Reynolds numbers. This approach is appropriate when bed load transport near incipient motion conditions is being studied, and allows for larger grain size scales than when full Shields parameter similarity is enforced. As part of an environmental project to rehabilitate sediment transport through bank erosion, this method has been applied to scale a Froude number criterion physical model of a reach of the Old Rhine (France). This has resulted in an undistorted scale of 40, and the use of sand as the model bank material. Each grain size has a different geometrical scale. The time scale for sediment motion is grain size and flow discharge dependent. An average time scale of 6 has therefore been used (four model hours!!e!!=!!e!!one prototype day). A strategy devised for the field case consists of two higher, larger island groynes that replace the three existing groynes, producing bank erosion for flow rates below the mean annual flow rate. Extrapolation of model behaviour to the prototype is not a major problem, but the volume of eroded bank material may be underestimated, mainly because of the relaxation of the Shields number similarity and the apparent cohesive properties of the model bank material.},

  abstract = {Bank erosion can be an important form of morphological adjustment in rivers. With the advances made in computational techniques, two-dimensional (2D) depth-averaged numerical models have become valuable tools for resolving many engineering problems dealing with sediment transport. The objective of this research work is to present a simple, new, bank-erosion operator that is integrated into a 2D Saint-Venant-Exner morphodynamic model. The numerical code is based on an unstructured grid of triangular elements and finite-element algorithms. The slope of each element in the grid is compared to the angle of repose of the bank material. Elements for which the slope is too steep are tilted to bring them to the angle of repose along a horizontal axis defined such that the volume loss above the axis is equal to the volume gain below, thus ensuring mass balance. The model performance is assessed using data from laboratory flume experiments and a scale model of the Old Rhine. For the flume experiment case with uniform bank material, relevant results are obtained for bank geometry changes. For the more challenging case (i.e. scale model of the Old Rhine with non-uniform bank material), the numerical model is capable of reproducing the main features of the bank failure, induced by the newly designed groynes, as well as the transport of the mobilized sediment material downstream. Some deviations between the computed results and measured data are, however, observed. They are ascribed to the effects of three-dimensional (3D) flow structures, pore pressure and cohesion, which are not considered in the present 2D model.},

The negative feedbacks between system components create a tendency towards the establishment of a dynamic equilibrium which is reached, however, only if the endogenic and exogenic conditions remain constant for the required relaxation time. The latter is shown to be a function of slope length, of the rate of uplift, of the denudational process type, and of the intensity of exogenic inputs (e.g. precipitation). Varying rock resistance leads to the development of shield inselbergs only if the rate of denudation becomes higher than the maximum possible weathering rate of the resistant bedrock.},

The former refers to the relationship between the process components of a system, the latter to the system as a whole. The tendency towards establishing a dynamic equilibrium is inherent in all natural systems that contain negative feedbacks between processes capable of compensating each other. In geomorphology, equilibrium tendencies of the mass budget are more relevant than those of the energy budget. The validity of the equilibrium concept is discussed at several scales from a slope point to entire slopes, drainage basins and mountain ranges. The effects of eksystemic changes vary depending upon the length of the intervals between such changes in comparison to the length of the required relaxation times. This relationship also applies to the influence of inherited forms, patterns and materials that have become components of present-day systems.},

The tangent of the yield angle is found to be linearly proportional to the spheroid concentration, which in turn depends upon the axial ratio. The degree and kind of dimensional ordering of the particles can at will be made dependent upon or independent of the concentration. The equations differ slightly, and only in their constants, according to the choice of ordering. Because of the decisive influence of shape inequalities, and the lesser influence of ordering, it appears inadmissible to apply to natural sedimentary particles of ellipsoidal form a model of yield angle based on the sphere. The equations are therefore relevant to the problems of the slope angles assumed by screes and talus and the slip faces of ripples and dunes.},

The model also shows that the proportion of flat-bedded sand-grade material in a lateral deposit is essentially independent of stream power but controlled by channel curvature and hence general sinuosity. The predictions of the model compare satisfactorily with the characteristics of selected coarse members in fining-upwards cycles of fluviatile origin from Devonian strata in Britain and North America.

  abstract = {Sediment often enters rivers in the form of sediment pulses associated with landslides and debris flows. This is particularly so in gravel-bed rivers in earthquake-prone mountain regions, such as Southwest China. Under such circumstances, sediment pulses can rapidly change river topography and leave the river in repeated states of gradual recovery. In this paper, we implement a one-dimensional morphodynamic model of river response to pulsed sediment supply. The model is validated using data from flume experiments, so demonstrating that it can successfully reproduce the overall morphodynamics of experimental pulses. The model is then used to explore the evolution of a gravel-bed river subject to cycled hydrographs and repeated sediment pulses. These pulses are fed into the channel in a fixed region centered at a point halfway down the calculational domain. The pulsed sediment supply is in addition to a constant sediment supply at the upstream end. Results indicate that the river can reach a mobile-bed equilibrium in which two regions exist within which bed elevation and surface grain size distribution vary periodically in time. One of these is at the upstream end, where a periodic discharge hydrograph and constant sediment supply are imposed, and the other is in a region about halfway down the channel where periodic sediment pulses are introduced. Outside these two regions, bed elevation and surface grain size distribution reach a mobile-bed equilibrium that is invariant in time. The zone of fluctuation-free mobile-bed equilibrium upstream of the pulse region is not affected by repeated sediment pulses under the scenarios tested, but downstream of the pulse region, the channel reaches different fluctuation-free mobile-bed equilibriums under different sediment pulse scenarios. The vertical bed structure predicted by the simulations indicates that the cyclic variation associated with the hydrograph and sediment pulses can affect the substrate stratigraphy to some depth.

  abstract = {The evolution of gravel bed rivers under cycled hydrographs and constant sediment supply is studied in this paper. With the aid of numerical modeling and flume experiments, previous research has indicated that under such water and sediment supply conditions, a river can reach a mobile-bed equilibrium characterized by a hydrograph boundary layer (HBL) located near the upstream end of the river. The HBL defines the spatial region within which riverbed topography and grain size respond to the hydrograph, and downstream of which these bed characteristics are invariant. However, neither the governing physical mechanisms nor the general applicability of the HBL is yet well understood. In this paper, we implement a 1-D morphodynamic model for this problem. The model is first validated with data for both flume experiments and numerical simulations. It is then implemented at field scale with grain size distributions varying from uniform sediment to very poorly sorted sediment mixtures. Our results show that the idea of an HBL is applicable in the case of uniform sediment, but breaks down in the case of poorly sorted sediment mixtures. In such cases, persistent low-amplitude bed load sheets emerge along the entire channel reach, in addition to HBL-like upstream boundary effects. Bed load sheets can be described as surface texture or grain size sorting waves in consonance with low-amplitude elevation variations, and are ascribed to nonlinear advection terms in the governing equations that vanish for uniform sediment, but become significant when sediment is very poorly sorted.},

Increments of the average annual total sediment load transported by various discharges were calculated by the flow-duration, sediment-transport-curve method for 15 gaging stations in the Yampa River basin of Colorado and Wyoming. A total sediment-transport curve was constructed for each gaging station by adding measured instantaneous suspended-sediment discharges to bedload-sediment discharges computed by the Meyer-Peter and Mueller relation. The streamflow durations were compiled from the respective gaging-station records. The quantity of sediment transported by discharges having various frequencies may be computed by combining these two relations. The 15 gaging stations had diverse hydraulic and sediment characteristics. Contributing drainage area ranged from 51.8 to 9,960 km2, and mean-annual discharge ranged from 0.040 to 43.9 m3/s. The median diameter of bed material ranged from 0.4 to 86 mm. Mean-annual sediment load from the drainage basins studied ranged from 500 to 1.3!!e!!106 metric tons per year. The effective discharges at the 15 gaging stations were equaled or exceeded on the average of between 1.5 days per year (0.4% of the time) and 11 days per year (3.0% of the time). The recurrence interval of the effective discharges ranged from 1.18 to 3.26 yr. on the annual flood series. To compare the effective discharge with the bankfull discharge, cross-sections were surveyed in a self-formed reach of the channel in the vicinity of each gaging station. The bankfull discharge was defined as the discharge which filled the channel to the level of the floodplain. At all gaging stations, the effective discharge and the bankfull discharge were nearly equal. Thus, the stream channels appear to be adjusted to their effective discharge.},

The standard two-fluid equations, however, sometimes predict the growth of instabilities in the flow, and occasionally become improperly posed. These difficulties have in the past led to the proposal of several different forms for the conservations equations. To help resolve these uncertainties a widely accepted form of the one-dimensional two-fluid equations is used to calculate wave propagation speeds, and stability limits, for the illustrative case of a frictionless horizontal stratified gas-liquid flow. Calculated propagation velocities are shown to agree with the appropriate limit of an exact solution, and the predicted stability limits are found consistent with available observations on the stability of the stratified flow regime. These comparisons help improve confidence in the ability of the two-fluid equations to analyse more complex problems in transient two-phase flow.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a probabilistic/deterministic model for the evaluation of the sediment transport rate in a stream. Starting from Einsteinâ€™s theory, the approach was obtained by trying to overcome some of the intrinsic limitations. The approach is based on two distinct probability functions, one relevant to the detachment of grains and the second relevant to the length of particle jumps. The sediment transport rate is obtained by integrating the distribution of the ranges of the particle jumps multiplied by the average particle velocity. The relationship for the average ranges of particle jumps is an opportune combination of the Einstein and Yalin expressions. The final formulation was calibrated by means of a large number of experimental data and also by comparison with some of the most widely-used empirical formulas. The results show a better agreement between theory and experiments than do the other theories analyzed.},

We propose expanding discussion and definition of the â€œactive layerâ€� in fluvial bedload transport to include the concept of the â€œmorphological active layer.â€� This is particularly applicable to laterally unstable rivers (such as braided rivers) in which progressive morphological change over short time periods is the process by which much of the bedload transport occurs. The morphological active layer is also distinguished by variable lateral and longitudinal extent continuity over a range of flows and transport intensity. We suggest that the issue of forms of active layer raised by Church and Haschenburger opens up an important discussion on the nature of bedload transport in relation to river morpho-dynamics over the range of river types.},

Flow velocity was measured at regularly-spaced intervals using a bidirectional electromagnetic current meter and the measured downstream and cross-stream velocities were converted to primary and secondary velocities to yield the secondary circulation. The primary (downstream) velocity field shows two high velocity streams from the two tributaries which merge (and, in some cases, accelerate) into a single high velocity core over the thalweg. Primary flow velocity declines as the flow expands and diverges at the downstream end of the confluence. The secondary circulation is dominated by two helical cells, back-to-back, plunging over the thalweg and diverging at the bed. This is the first confirmation of this flow structure in confluences, based on field measurements. The strength of the secondary cells declines downstream through each confluence, and laterally away from the thalweg area in cross-section. There is also a tendency for one cell, from the larger of the tributaries, to override the other. The secondary and primary flow structure and strength differs slightly between the two confluences and this is reflected in differences in scour hole form.},

  abstract  = {Large-scale morphology, in particular meander bend depth, bar dimensions, and bifurcation dynamics, are greatly affected by the deflection of sediment transport on transverse bed slopes due to gravity and by secondary flows. Overestimating the transverse bed slope effect in morphodynamic models leads to flattening of the morphology, while underestimating leads to unrealistically steep bars and banks and a higher braiding index downstream. However, existing transverse bed slope predictors are based on a small set of experiments with a minor range of flow conditions and sediment sizes, and in practice models are calibrated on measured morphology. The objective of this research is to experimentally quantify the transverse bed slope effect for a large range of near-bed flow conditions with varying secondary flow intensity, sediment sizes (0.17â€“4 mm), sediment transport mode, and bed state to test existing predictors. We conducted over 200 experiments in a rotating annular flume with counterrotating floor, which allows control of the secondary flow intensity separate from the streamwise flow velocity. Flow velocity vectors were determined with a calibrated analytical model accounting for rough bed conditions. We isolated separate effects of all important parameters on the transverse slope. Resulting equilibrium transverse slopes show a clear trend with varying sediment mobilities and secondary flow intensities that deviate from known predictors depending on Shields number, and strongly depend on bed state and sediment transport mode. Fitted functions are provided for application in morphodynamic modeling.},

  abstract =  {Sediment particles transported as bed load undergo alternating periods of motion and rest, particularly at weak flow intensity. Bed load transport can be investigated by either following the motion of individual particles (Lagrangian approach) or observing the phenomenon at prescribed locations (Eulerian approach). In this paper, the Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions are merged into a unifying framework that includes definitions for quantities used to describe the kinematics of particle motion, as well as the relationships among these quantities. The alternation of motion and rest is represented by two complementary descriptions: (i) proportion of motion, indicating either the relative time spent in motion by an individual particle or the relative number of moving particles; (ii) persistence of motion, indicating the extent to which the process consists of relatively few long periods of motion or of many short ones. The framework only involves first moments of the key quantities. The conceptual developments are tested against results from an experiment with weak bed load transport, demonstrating the soundness of the approach. From an operational point of view, a Lagrangian observation is difficult to perform, since the particle motion is usually investigated for finite spatial domains (e.g., a measurement window within a laboratory or natural reach). Strategies to overcome such limitations are described, suggesting the possibility of obtaining unbiased mean values for Lagrangian descriptors. The proposed framework can be used in any study aimed at parameterizing the kinematic properties of bed load particles as functions of the hydrodynamic conditions.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of the statistical distributions of particle hop properties (distances, travel, and rest times) enables a deeper understanding of bed load sediment transport. However, the measurement of particle hops is prone to censorship: Since many hops cross the boundaries of a spatial-temporal observation window, one knows that they exist but does not know how long they are. An option is to build particle hop samples considering only the hops that are completely observed and excluding (censoring) those observed only partially. Such a choice, however, biases the frequency distributions of the hop properties. Moreover, censorship acts in both space and time, and a hop censored in time will also not contribute to a sample of hop lengths, and vice versa. Time censorship similarly applies to particle rest times. This paper presents a theoretical formulation of censorship that leads to nonparametric bias corrections recovering estimates of values of the underlying distributions of hop distance, travel time, and rest time up to sampling window dimensions. We illustrate the occurrence and consequences of experimental censorship, and the benefit of applying the bias corrections, for both synthetic and laboratory samples of particle hops. The corrections reasonably recover the relative proportions of frequency distributions represented by the data up to the sampling dimensions and improve the estimates of the first two moments of particle hop properties. Recommendations are given regarding how the size of an observation window may be chosen to reduce the bias to below some prescribed value, if the forms of the underlying distributions are known.},

In the former, {\$}{\$}F{\backslash}rightarrow 2^+{\$}{\$}F{\textrightarrow}2+, limit, the shallow water equations are formally approximated by a Korteweg-de Vries/Kuramoto--Sivashinsky (KdV--KS) equation that is a singular perturbation of the standard Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation modeling horizontal shallow water flow. Our main analytical result is to rigorously validate this formal limit, showing that stability as {\$}{\$}F{\backslash}rightarrow 2^+{\$}{\$}F{\textrightarrow}2+is equivalent to stability of the corresponding KdV--KS waves in the KdV limit. Together with recent results obtained for KdV--KS by Johnson--Noble--Rodrigues--Zumbrun and Barker, this gives not only the first rigorous verification of stability for any single viscous St. Venant roll wave, but a complete classification of stability in the weakly unstable limit. In the remainder of the paper, we investigate numerically and analytically the evolution of the stability diagram as Froude number increases to infinity. Notably, we find transition at around {\$}{\$}F=2.3{\$}{\$}F=2.3from weakly unstable to different, large-F behavior, with stability determined by simple power-law relations.

  abstract = {A variety of formulae has been developed to predict bed load transport in gravel bed rivers, ranging from simple regressions to complex multiparameter formulations. The ability to test these formulae across numerous field sites has, until recently, been hampered by a paucity of bed load transport data for gravel bed rivers. We use 2104 bed load transport observations in 24 gravel bed rivers in Idaho to assess the performance of eight different formulations of four bed load transport equations. Results show substantial differences in performance but no consistent relationship between formula performance and degree of calibration or complexity. However, formulae containing a transport threshold typically exhibit poor performance. Furthermore, we find that the transport data are best described by a simple power function of discharge. From this we propose a new bed load transport equation and identify channel and watershed characteristics that control the exponent and coefficient of the proposed power function. We find that the exponent is principally a factor of supply-related channel armoring (transport capacity in excess of sediment supply), whereas the coefficient is related to drainage area (a surrogate for absolute sediment supply). We evaluate the accuracy of the proposed power function at 17 independent test sites.},

  abstract = {The migration of the lithofacies boundaries preserved in the sedimentary record is key to interpreting changes in depositional environments. Grain size is one of the most recognizable physical characteristics of lithofacies. The advance and retreat of grain-size breaks, as a proxy for lithofacies boundaries (e.g. gravel�sand transition), is commonly attributed to variations in external controls (e.g. climate, sea level and tectonic subsidence). While most models of fluviodeltaic systems focus on predicting the response of the shoreline to these forcings, none have thoroughly incorporated the migration of grain-size transitions (GST) that coevolve with the shoreline. We present a numerical delta evolution model that treats both the shoreline and GST as moving boundaries to provide quantitative understanding of the dynamic interaction between the downstream boundary (shoreline) and the upstream lithofacies boundaries (GSTs) of the fluviodeltaic system under relative sea-level rise. We tested a range of relative sea-level rise rates in the model. The shoreline and GST gradually reduced their progradation rates and eventually retreated landward as the fluviodeltaic topset and foreset elongated. However, their timings of retreat were different, resulting in a counterintuitive case for a quicker retreat of GST while the shoreline still continued to advance. A series of scaled flume experiments with a sand and crushed walnut sediment mixture captured the same behaviours of these two moving boundaries. We found that GST experienced higher relative sea-level rise (RSLR) rates than the shoreline. This additional RSLR rate scales with the downstream river slope and the shoreline progradation rate to cause earlier GST retreat in comparison to the shoreline. The fundamental understanding from this study of migration of both the GST and shoreline in fluviodeltaic systems will aid in accurately assessing the trajectories of GST in sedimentary strata as a proxy for environmental change.},

  abstract  = {Degradation of alluvial channels in cohesive sediments was studied in 15 m and 20 m long flumes with a slope of 0Â°01 cm/cm. Degradation was initiated by lowering base level to a fixed position, and the development of the longitudinal profile of the channel is analysed through a model formulated as a heat (diffusion) equation. It is based on the equation of sediment continuity, combined with an assumption regarding sediment transport, namely that sediment discharge is linearly proportional to the channel slope. In accordance with the boundary and initial conditions imposed by the experimental setup and procedure, the basic equation is amenable to an analytical solution, which defines bed elevation at any distance and time, as a function of the amount of base-level lowering and a â€˜diffusionâ€™ coefficient. Additional problems arising from bank erosion and channel armouring are also treated successfully within the framework of the same model.The results show that in homogeneous alluvial sediments, not subject to armouring, the ultimate result of base-level lowering by a certain amount is degradation all along the channel by the same amount. The main impact of erosion is felt in the early stages after initiation of the process, and mainly near the mouth. The rate of degradation at any station along the channel reaches a peak and then slowly decreases with time, and the peak rate is attenuated with distance from the outlet. The model permits the prediction of intermediate stages of profile development at any distance from the outlet and at different times.},

  abstract = {This work deals with the formulation and numerical implementation of a two-dimensional mathematical and numerical model describing open channel hydrodynamics, sediment and/or scalar transport and riverbed evolution in curved channels. It is shown that a well balanced 2D model can predict flow features, sediment and scalar concentration, and bed elevation with an accuracy that is suitable for practical river engineering. The term â€œbalancedâ€� implies that important physical processes are modeled with a similar degree of complexity and exhaustiveness. The starting point of the model formulation is the assumption of self-similarity of vertical velocity profiles (horizontal velocities in the longitudinal and transverse directions), that are scaled by shear velocity and streamline curvature, both resolved by the model. The former is scaled by a bed-resistance coefficient that must be estimated or calibrated â€“ as usual â€“ on a application-specific basis, and the latter is computed by a new, grid-based but grid orientation independent, scheme that acts on the discrete solution. All processes, including bottom shear, momentum dispersion, scalar dispersion, turbulent diffusion, bed load, and suspended load, are modeled using physically based, averaged values of empirical or semi-empirical constants, and consistently with the assumed velocity profiles (and bed-generated turbulence). Bed deformation modeling can be implemented with either an equilibrium or non-equilibrium formulation of the Exner equation, depending on the adaptation length scale, which must be taken under consideration if significantly larger than the length scale of the spatial discretization. The governing equations are solved by high-resolution, unstructured-grid Godunov method, which is elsewhere tested and shown to be reliable and second-order accurate. Application of the model to laboratory test cases, using standard parameter values and previously reported bed-resistance coefficients, gives results comparable to many 2D and 3D models previously applied to the same cases, most part of which benefit from case-specific parameter tuning. There are obviously intrinsic limits to the descriptive ability of 2D models in river modeling, but the results of this study point to the utility and cost-effectiveness of a well-designed 2D model.},

  abstract  = {Abstract A realistic sediment transport simulation model must incorporate an unsteady, non-uniform flow computation component, a means of simulating bed load and suspended sediment transport and their interactions, and bed armouring and elevation accounting routines. A model embodying these components has been developed for upland streams with tributaries. The streams are assumed to have a wash load, sand or gravel beds, and erosion resistant banks. After calibration of the model using 15 days of data collected during the spring of 1975 from sections of the East Fork River in Wyoming and its tributary Muddy Creek, a standard error of prediction of 50 per cent of the average observed bed load discharge of 3.43 lb/s (1.55 kg/s) was obtained. The total bed load outflow for the simulation period was 20 per cent greater than that obtained from bed load discharge measurements and 94 per cent greater than a rough estimate of volumetric change obtained from observations of bed elevations. A fortunate characteristic of sediment transport models is that the longitudinal variation of the transport rate decreases with time as improperly posed initial conditions are !!e!!healed!!e!! by simulated erosion and deposition. Unfortunately, this process consumes appreciable simulation time which necessitates relatively long data collection periods to achieve satisfactory calibration.},

These series correspond to various climatic and hydrological conditions, drainage areas ranging from 10 to 105�km2, and are from 22 to 95�years long. The peaks-over-threshold method has been used with a set of semi-parametric estimators (Hill and Generalized Hill estimators), and parametric estimators (maximum likelihood and L-moments). We discuss the respective interest of the estimators and compare their respective estimates of the shape parameter of the probability distribution of the peaks. We emphasize the influence of the selected number of the highest observations that are used in the estimation procedure and in this respect the particular interest of the semi-parametric estimators. Nevertheless, the various estimators agree on the prevalence of heavy tails and we point out some links between their presence and hydrological and climatic conditions.},

River bars develop as an instability of the plane bed to an infinitesimal perturbation, which grows in time to eventually reach a finite amplitude. We here determine, with reference to both bed and suspended loads, a closed form for the finite amplitude, through the nonlinear Center Manifold Projection technique. Results show that suspension plays a destabilizing role in bar instability, affecting both the bar wavelength (linear analysis) and the bar amplitude (weakly nonlinear analysis). This proves the importance of considering suspended load for practical purposes. The outcomes of the model are satisfactorily compared with field observations.},

Two Nikon D5100 cameras and non-proprietary photogrammetric software for camera calibration and DEM reconstruction are used for the study. A measured DEM is compared point by point with the ground truth and displays a very high measurement accuracy. The 3D printing of ground truths facilitates fast and versatile evaluation of both the DEM quality and the sensitivity of its errors to changes in surface topography and collection parameters. It has the potential to streamline evaluations of calibration and image quality, as well as error filtering strategies. Ultimately, 3D printed models will help in exploring stereomatching error reductions in occluded regions and defining the most suitable strategy for gravel-bed DEM collection, both in air and through water.},

  abstract = {Grain-scale monitoring of fluvial morphology is important for the evaluation of river system dynamics. Significant progress in remote sensing and computer performance allows rapid high-resolution data acquisition, however, applications in fluvial environments remain challenging. Even in a controlled environment, such as a laboratory, the extensive acquisition workflow is prone to the propagation of errors in digital elevation models (DEMs). This is valid for both of the common surface recording techniques: digital stereo photogrammetry and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). The optimisation of the acquisition process, an effective way to reduce the occurrence of errors, is generally limited by the use of commercial software. Therefore, the removal of evident blunders during post processing is regarded as standard practice, although this may introduce new errors. This paper presents a detailed evaluation of a digital stereo-photogrammetric workflow developed for fluvial hydraulic applications. The introduced workflow is user-friendly and can be adapted to various close-range measurements: imagery is acquired with two Nikon D5100 cameras and processed using non-proprietary â€œon-the-jobâ€� calibration and dense scanline-based stereo matching algorithms. Novel ground truth evaluation studies were designed to identify the DEM errors, which resulted from a combination of calibration errors, inaccurate image rectifications and stereo-matching errors. To ensure optimum DEM quality, we show that systematic DEM errors must be minimised by ensuring a good distribution of control points throughout the image format during calibration. DEM quality is then largely dependent on the imagery utilised. We evaluated the open access multi-scale Retinex algorithm to facilitate the stereo matching, and quantified its influence on DEM quality. Occlusions, inherent to any roughness element, are still a major limiting factor to DEM accuracy. We show that a careful selection of the camera-to-object and baseline distance reduces errors in occluded areas and that realistic ground truths help to quantify those errors.},

The experiments were aimed at describing quantitatively the evolution of a single laterally unconstrained channel until the occurrence of the first bifurcation. An objective criterion for the occurrence of the bifurcation has been established using the data provided by the Fourier analysis of the evolving bank profiles; the procedure enabled us to characterize the morphodynamic sequence leading to flow and channel bifurcation. The sought outcome of the investigation is to derive a suitable description of the bifurcation process to be implemented in predictive models for braiding evolution, for which physically based nodal point conditions would be highly desirable.},

Results show the occurrence of regular fluctuations in the discharge distribution at the bifurcation node, which are strictly related to bar migration. The effectiveness of bars in conditioning the bifurcation behavior increases with bar amplitude and decreases with bar migration speed. Four qualitatively different behaviors of the system are observed as the controlling parameters of the flow are varied within a range significant for gravel bed rivers.

Adopting a simple theoretical framework, we develop a numerical model which couples hydromorphodynamics with biomass dynamics. We perform a sensitivity analysis considering several parameters as flood intensity, type of vegetation, and groundwater level. We find that the inclusion of vegetation determines a threshold behavior, identifying two possible equilibrium configurations: unvegetated versus vegetated bars. Stable vegetation patterns can establish only under specific conditions, which depend on the different environmental and species-related characteristics. From a management point of view, model results show that relatively small changes in water availability or species composition may determine a sudden shift between dynamic unvegetated conditions to more stable, vegetated rivers.},

Progress in understanding the fluid dynamics associated with alluvial dunes has been significant in the last 15 years and has witnessed huge advances in field, laboratory, and numerical investigations. Progress has been made in detailing the principal features of mean and turbulent flow over asymmetric dunes that possess flow separation in their leesides and how these forms affect both downstream boundary layer structure and stress partitioning over the dune. Additionally, the links between sediment transport over dunes and instantaneous coherent flow structures are being increasingly understood, with the feedback of dune three-dimensionality upon flow and sediment dynamics over these bed forms beginning to be recognized as vital. Such research now provides an outstanding background for beginning to address areas of greater complexity that will enable a fuller understanding of these important natural features. This review paper summarizes the principal features of mean and turbulent flow over alluvial sand dunes. Five areas are then highlighted and discussed as a possible focus for future research: (1) the influence of dune leeside angle upon flow processes in the dune wake and downstream flow field, (2) the influence of three-dimensionality in dune shape upon the generation of turbulence and distribution of bed shear stress, (3) flow field modification resulting from bed form superimposition and amalgamation, (4) the scale and topology of dune-related turbulence and its interactions with sediment transport and the flow surface, and (5) the influence of suspended sediment on the dune flow field and dune morphology.},

  abstract = {The motion of bedload particles is diffusive and occurs within at least three scale ranges: local, intermediate and global, each of which with a distinctly different diffusion regime. However, these regimes, extensions of the scale ranges and boundaries between them remain to be better defined and quantified. These issues are explored using a Lagrangian model of saltating grains over the uniform fixed bed. The model combines deterministic particle motion dynamics with stochastic characteristics such as probability distributions of step lengths and resting times. Specifically, it is proposed that a memoryless exponential distribution is an appropriate model for the distribution of rest periods while the probability that a particle stops after a current jump follows a binomial distribution, which is a distribution with lack of memory as well. These distributions are incorporated in the deterministic Lagrangian model of saltating grains and extensive numerical simulations are conducted for the identification of the diffusive behavior of particles at different time scales. Based on the simulations and physical considerations, the local, intermediate, and global scale ranges are quantified and the transitions from one range to another are studied for a spectrum of motion parameters. The obtained results demonstrate that two different time scales should be considered for parameterization of diffusive behavior within intermediate and global scale ranges and for defining the local--intermediate and intermediate--global boundaries. The simulations highlight the importance of the distributions of the step lengths and resting times for the identification of the boundaries (or transition intervals) between the scale ranges.},

  abstract  = {Sequence-stratigraphic models for fourth to sixth order, glacio-eustatic sequences based only on relative sea-level variations result in simplified and potentially false interpretations. Glacio-eustatic sea-level variations form only one aspect of cyclic climate variation; other aspects, such as variations in fluvial water discharge, vegetation cover, weathering and sediment supply can lead to variable sediment yield, thus adding complexity to sequence-stratigraphic patterns normally attributed to sea-level variations. Analogue flume models show a significant impact of water discharge on the timing and character of sequence boundaries, and on changes in the relative importance of systems tracts, as expressed in sediment volumes. Four deltas, generated under the influence of an identical sea-level curve, and affected by different water-discharge cycles were generated in the Eurotank facility: (1) constant discharge; (2) high-frequency discharge variations (HFD); (3) discharge leading sea level by a quarter phase; (4) discharge lagging sea level by a quarter phase. HFD shift the parasequence stacking pattern consistently but do not alter large-scale delta architecture. Water-discharge changes that lead sea-level changes result in high sediment yield during sea-level rise and in the poor development of maximum flooding surfaces. Delta-front erosion during sea-level fall is expressed by multiple, small channels related to upstream avulsions, and does not result in an incised valley that efficiently routs sediment to the shelf edge. When water-discharge changes lag sea-level changes, sediment yield is high during falling sea level and results in rapid progradation during forced regression. Erosion from incised valleys is strong on the proximal delta top and dissipates towards the delta front. The combination of high discharge and sea-level fall provides the most efficient mode of valley incision and sediment transport to the shelf edge. During sea-level rise, low water discharge results in sediment starvation and well-developed maximum flooding surfaces. Water-discharge variations thus alter sequence-stratigraphic patterns and provide an alternative explanation to the amplitude of sea-level fall for generating either type 1 or 2 erosional unconformities.},

  abstract = {Phenomena concerning flow, morphology, and water quality in rivers are often investigated by means of a depth-integrated flow model, coupled to a sediment transport model and a water quality model. In such depth!!e!!integrated models, the vertical structure of the flow is represented by a closure submodel, which mainly has to account for the secondary circulation, which (1) redistributes by advection the flow, the boundary shear stresses, the sediment transport, and dissolved and suspended matter, (2) causes the direction of the bed shear stress to deviate from the direction of the depth-averaged velocity and thereby influences the bed topography, and (3) gives rise to additional friction losses as compared with straight uniform flow. The commonly used linear closure submodels are shown to fail in reproducing essential features in moderately to strongly curved flow, because they neglect the feedback between the downstream velocity and the secondary circulation. A nonlinear closure submodel taking this feedback into account is proposed and shown to yield results that compare well with experimental data, even for very strongly curved flow. The feedback effects turn out to be controlled almost exclusively by a single parameter, which enables their parameterization in a relatively simple way. This control parameter also helps to objectively distinguish weak, moderate, and strongly curved flows. The proposed closure submodel has the potential of improving the performance of depth-integrated flow-sediment-water quality models without much extra computational effort.},

  abstract = {Flow in open-channel bends is characterized by cross-stream circulation, which redistributes the velocity and the boundary shear stress and thereby shapes the characteristic bed topography. Besides a center-region cell, classical helical motion, a weaker counterrotating outer-bank cell often exists. In spite of its engineering importance, the mechanisms underlying distributions of the velocity and the boundary shear stress in open-channel bends, and especially the role of both circulation cells, are not yet fully understood. In order to investigate these mechanisms, an evaluation is made of the various terms in the momentum equations based on the data measured, which gave the following results. The outer-bank cell forms a buffer layer that protects the outer bank from any influence of the center-region cell and keeps the core of maximum velocity a distance from the bank. Advective momentum transport by the center-region cell is a dominant mechanism; it significantly contributes to the observed outward shift of the downstream velocity and the bed shear stress and to flattening of the vertical profiles of the velocity. This important advective momentum redistribution has to be included in the depth-integrated flow models often used in engineering practice. Commonly used linear models overpredict the effects of the center-region cell. Based on results of the analysis of experimental data, these models are extended by accounting for the feedback between the center-region cell and the downstream velocity. The nonlinear model obtained clearly reveals the mechanisms of the center-region cell and its advective momentum transport. An analysis of nonlinear model results confirms and complements the analysis of experimental data. A true quasithree-dimensional flow model is obtained by coupling this nonlinear model to depth-integrated flow models, thus providing an engineering tool for morphodynamical investigations.},

  abstract = {The paper investigates the influence of relative bend curvature on secondary flow, energy losses, and turbulence in sharp openâ€�channel bends. These processes are important in natural streams with respect to sediment transport, the bathymetry and planimetry, mixing and spreading of pollutants, heat, oxygen, nutrients and biological species, and the conveyance capacity. Laboratory experiments were carried out in a configuration with rectangular cross section, consisting of a 193Â° bend of constant radius of curvature, preceded and followed by straight reaches. This somewhat unnatural configuration allows investigating the adaptation of mean flow and turbulence to curvature changes in openâ€�channel bends, without contamination by other effects such as a mobile bed topography. Experiments were carried out for three different values of the curvature ratio, defined as the ratio of centerline radius of curvature over flow depth, which is the principal curvature parameter for hydrodynamic processes. Commonly used soâ€�called linear models predict secondary flow to increase linearly with the curvature ratio. The reported experiments show that the secondary flow hardly increases in the investigated very sharp bends when the curvature ratio is further increased. This phenomenon is called saturation. Similar saturation is observed for the energy losses and the turbulence. This paper focuses on the analysis and modeling of the saturation of energy losses and turbulence. Secondary flow is found to be the dominant contribution to the curvatureâ€�induced increase in turbulence production, which leads to increased energy losses. The curvatureâ€�induced turbulence is explained by the fact that the turbulence dissipation lags behind the turbulence production, in agreement with the concept of the turbulence energy cascade. A 1â€�D model is proposed for the curvatureâ€�induced energy losses and turbulence. It could extend 1â€�D or depthâ€�averaged 2â€�D models that are commonly used in longâ€�term (scale of a flood event to geological scales) or largeâ€�scale (scale of a river basin) investigations on flood propagation, hazard mapping, water quality modeling, and planimetric river evolution.},

  abstract = {The bed topography and associated flow field are investigated in a laboratory configuration with parameters that are representative for sharp natural meander bends. Zones of inward mass transport are characterized by a quasiâ€�linear transverse bed profile, whereas zones of outward mass transport, induced by pronounced curvature variations, are characterized by a quasiâ€�horizontal shallow point bar at the inside of the bend, a deep pool at the outside, and an increase in overall crossâ€�sectional area. These quasiâ€�bilinear bed profiles can be attributed to the curvatureâ€�induced secondary flow that is confined to the pool. Topographic steering, mainly due to mass conservation, concentrates the major part of the discharge over the deepest zones of the bend. But the pattern of depthâ€�averaged velocities, which is relevant with respect to the development of the bed topography, does not show maximum values over the deepest zones. A termâ€�byâ€�term analysis of the depthâ€�averaged streamwise momentum equation reveals that the water surface gradient is the principal mechanism with respect to flow velocity redistribution, although inertia and secondary flow are also processes of dominant order of magnitude. A required condition for the occurrence of adverse pressure gradients and flow recirculation due to planform curvature variations is established. A different type of flow recirculation, due to a subtle feedback between the flow and the bed topography, occurs over the point bar. The neglect of the influence of vertical velocities impinging on the bed in models for sediment transport is identified as a major shortcoming in the modeling of the morphodynamics of meandering river channels.},

  abstract  = {Downstream fining of bed sediment in alluvial rivers is usually gradual, but often an abrupt decrease in characteristic grain size occurs from about 10 to 1!!e!!mm, i.e., a gravel-sand transition (GST) or gravel front. Here we present an analytical model of GST migration that explicitly accounts for gravel and sand transport and deposition in the gravel reach, sea level change, subsidence, and delta progradation. The model shows that even a limited gravel supply to a sand bed reach induces progradation of a gravel wedge and predicts the circumstances required for the gravel front to advance, retreat, and halt. Predicted modern GST migration rates agree well with measured data at Allt Dubhaig and the Fraser River, and the model qualitatively captures the behavior of other documented gravel fronts. The analysis shows that sea level change, subsidence, and delta progradation have a significant impact on the GST position in lowland rivers.},

  abstract = {When the water discharge, sediment supply, and base level vary around stable values, an alluvial river evolves toward a mean equilibrium or graded state with small fluctuations around this mean state (i.e.!!e!!a dynamic or statistical equilibrium state). Here we present analytical relations describing the mean equilibrium geometry of an alluvial river under variable flow by linking channel slope, width, and bed surface texture. The solution holds in river normal flow zones (or outside the hydrograph boundary layer and the backwater zone) and accounts for grain size selective transport and particle abrasion. We consider the variable flow rate as a series of continuously changing yet steady water discharges (here termed an alternating steady discharge). The analysis also provides a solution to the channel-forming water discharge, which is here defined as the steady water discharge that, given the mean sediment supply, provides the same equilibrium channel slope as the natural long-term hydrograph. The channel-forming water discharge for the gravel load is larger than the one associated with the sand load. The analysis illustrates how the load is distributed over the range of water discharge in the river normal flow zone, which we term the !!e!!normal flow load distribution!!e!!. The fact that the distribution of the (imposed) sediment supply spatially adapts to this normal flow load distribution is the origin of the hydrograph boundary layer. The results quantify the findings by Wolman and Miller [1960] regarding the relevance of both magnitude and frequency of the flow rate with respect to channel geometry.},

  abstract = {In this article we propose a stochastic bed load transport formulation within the framework of the frictional shallow-water equations in which the sediment transport rate results from the difference between the entrainment and deposition of particles. First we show that the Saint-Venant-Exner equations are linearly unstable in most cases for a uniform base flow down an inclined erodible bed for Shields numbers in excess of the threshold for incipient sediment motion allowing us to compute noise-induced pattern formation for Froude numbers below 2. The wavelength of the bed forms are selected naturally due to the absolute character of the bed instability and the existence of a maximum growth rate at a finite wavelength when the particle diffusivity coefficient and the water eddy viscosity are present as for Turing-like instability. A numerical method is subsequently developed to analyze the performance of the model and theoretical results through three examples: the simulation of the fluctuations of the particle concentration using a stochastic Langevin equation, the deterministic simulation of anti-dunes formation over an erodible slope in full sediment-mobility conditions, and the computation of noise-induced pattern formation in hybrid stochastic-deterministic flows down a periodic flume. The full non-linear numerical simulations are in excellent agreement with the theoretical solutions. We conclude highlighting that the proposed depth-averaged formulation explains the developments of upstream migrating anti-dunes in straight flumes since the seminar experiments by GilbertÂ (1914).},

Within the context of a one-dimensional approach, the nodal point conditions play a crucial rule, as pointed out by Wang et al. [1995] who propose an empirical relationship relating water and sediment flow rates into the downstream branches. In the present paper, an alternative formulation of nodal point conditions is proposed based on a quasi two-dimensional approach. The results show that, if the Shields parameter of the upstream channel is large enough, the system only admits of one solution with both branches open, which is invariably stable. As the Shields parameter of the upstream channel decreases, two further stable solutions appear characterized by a different partition of water discharge into the downstream branches: in this case, the previous solution becomes unstable. Theoretical findings are confirmed by the numerical solution of the nonlinear one-dimensional equations.},

Symmetrical bifurcations were often found to be unstable so that one branch downstream of the bifurcation enlarged while the other dwindled. A unified theory able to predict bifurcation stability in both gravel bed and sand bed rivers is still lacking. Here we develop a new theory for the stability of bifurcations for the entire range of gravel bed to sand bed rivers. The theory indicates opposite behavior of gravel bed and sand bed rivers: we predict that symmetrical bifurcations are inherently stable for intermediate Shields stresses but are inherently unstable for the low and high Shields stresses found in the majority of rivers on Earth. In the latter conditions asymmetrical bifurcations are stable. These predictions are corroborated by observations and have ramifications for many environmental problems in fluviodeltaic settings.},

In this study structured, unstructured and hybrid grids with a high and low resolution were compared. As a case study, we use the Waal River (with main channel and floodplains). We studied simulated water levels using the six grids, considering equal main channel friction, which enabled to study the isolated effects of grid shape and size. The spread in simulated water levels was found to be rather large with a maximum deviation of 78Â cm. Therefore, calibration was performed such that simulated water levels resembled measured water levels by adjusting the main channel friction. This enabled us to draw conclusions on the choice of optimal usage of the grids in engineering studies. Bathymetry accuracy and numerical friction, both as a result of grid resolution, and numerical viscosity as a result of grid shape play a vital role. The analysis shows that unstructured grids are affected most by the calibration which is reflected in the wide spreading of calibrated friction values. From the six grids studied, the hybrid grid with curvilinear grid cells in the main channel and triangular grid cells in the floodplain is recommended for hydraulic modelling since computation time is low, while model output shows sufficient accuracy.},

Several analytical techniques-such as the Green function formalism and renormalization group methods-are also exposed. Care is devoted to the problem of sample to sample fluctuations, particularly acute here. We consider the specific effects of a bias on anomalous diffusion, and discuss the generalizations of Einstein's relation in the presence of disorder. An effort is made to illustrate the theoretical models by describing many physical situations where anomalous diffusion laws have been-or could be-observed.},

  abstract = {Abstract This study is based upon a large set of core drilling data (lithology and well logs) of the RhÃ´ne delta plain extracted from the French geological survey (BRGM) databank. The main goals are to set up a sequence stratigraphy model of the postglacial sedimentary bodies of the RhÃ´ne delta plain and to evaluate the relative importance and influence of the main controlling factors and processes (subsidence, eustasy, sediment yield, climate, anthropic influence) that led to their formation. First, a detailed study (60 drill holes with tenth meters spacing) was performed on a restricted area (Saint FerrÃ©ol lobe, 1.5 km2). Correlation between well logs data and lithological data allows to identify the main sediment lithofacies and key surfaces, and to set up a detailed stratigraphic framework. Postglacial deposits are subdivided into a lower member of coastal plain and backbarrier deposits and an upper member of marine deposits (coastal barrier environments). Following, the analysis of 160 wells distributed on the whole delta plain depicts the large scale architecture of postglacial deposits. In the upper delta plain, fluviatile coastal plain and palustral deposits prevail. In the lower delta plain, the deposits are made of a lower part of coastal plain deposits organized into four units (T1â€“T4) stacked in a retrograding pattern. This lower member is truncated by an erosional surface progressively deepening seaward. Above, an upper member of marine deposits thickening seaward and coarsening upward is organized into five units (P1â€“P5) arranged in a prograding pattern. The core drilling data have been correlated with high resolution seismic data on the adjacent shelf and are interpreted in sequence stratigraphy terms. The retrogradational units (T1â€“T4), with coastal plain deposits, are correlative of shelf units and constitute together trangressive parasequences deposited during phases of slowing down of postglacial sea level rise. The upper marine units (P1â€“P5), arranged in a prograding pattern, represent parasequences of the Highstand Systems Tract which have prograded since the period of reduced rate of sea level rise at the end of the Holocene. During this period, the evolution of the sedimentary RhÃ´ne system was controlled by major changes of the hydrologic regime. Periods of increased sediment discharge, aggradation of the floodplain and progradation of the coastline are correlated with the development of the deltaic lobes of the RhÃ´ne d'Ulmet (unit P3) and of the RhÃ´ne du Bras de Fer (unit P4). Unit P5 correlates with adjacent prograding shelf unit that developed seaward of the present RhÃ´ne river mouth. Comparison of sea level history between the Eastern part of the RhÃ´ne delta plain and the rocky coast to the east of Marseille suggests that tecto-subsident movements account for part of the changes in relative sea-level. Moreover, the truncation of transgressive and progradation surfaces, the unevenness of the MFS, the dilatation of sedimentary record and deformations of key surfaces are also in favor of differential subsidence.},

  abstract = {Random walk models of fluvial bed load transport use probability distributions to describe the distance a grain travels during an episode of transport and the time it rests after deposition. These models typically employ probability distributions with finite first and second moments, reflecting an underlying assumption that all the factors that influence sediment transport tend to combine in such a way that the length of a step or the duration of a rest can be characterized by a mean value surrounded by a specific amount of variability. The observation that many transport systems exhibit apparent scaleâ€�dependent behavior and nonâ€�Fickian dispersion suggests that this assumption is not always valid. We revisit a nearly 50 year old tracer experiment in which the tracer plume exhibits the hallmarks of dispersive transport described by a step length distribution with a divergent second moment and no characteristic dispersive size. The governing equation of this type of random walk contains fractionalâ€�order derivatives. We use the data from the experiment to test two versions of a fractionalâ€�order model of dispersive fluvial bed load transport. The first version uses a heavyâ€�tailed particle step length distribution with a divergent second moment to reproduce the anomalously high fraction of tracer mass observed in the downstream tail of the spatial distribution. The second version adds a feature that partitions mass into a detectable mobile phase and an undetectable, immobile phase. This twoâ€�phase transport model predicts other features observed in the data: a decrease in the amount of detected tracer mass over the course of the experiment and enhanced particle retention near the source. The fractionalâ€�order models match the observed plume shape and growth rates better than prior attempts with classical models.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Random walk models of fluvial sediment transport recognize that grains move intermittently, with short duration steps separated by rests that are comparatively long. These models are built upon the probability distributions of the step length and the resting time. Motivated by these models, tracer experiments have attempted to measure directly the steps and rests of sediment grains in natural streams. This paper describes results from a large tracer experiment designed to test stochastic transport models. We used passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags to label 893 coarse gravel clasts and placed them in Halfmoon Creek, a small alpine stream near Leadville, Colorado, USA. The PIT tags allow us to locate and identify tracers without picking them up or digging them out of the streambed. They also enable us to find a very high percentage of our rocks, 98\% after three years and 96\% after the fourth year. We use the annual tracer displacement to test two stochastic transport models, the Einsteinâ€“Hubbellâ€“Sayre (EHS) model and the Yangâ€“Sayre gamma-exponential model (GEM). We find that the GEM is a better fit to the observations, particularly for slower moving tracers and suggest that the strength of the GEM is that the gamma distribution of step lengths approximates a compound Poisson distribution.

However, heavy-tailed resting times have never been directly observed in the field over multiple floods. Using 9Â years of data from a large bed load tracer experiment, I show that the spatial variance of the tracer plume scales faster than linearly with integrated excess stream power, indicating anomalous superdiffusion. The superdiffusion is caused by a heavy-tailed distribution of observed storage times that is fit with a truncated Pareto distribution with a tail parameter that is predicted by anomalous diffusion theory. The heavy-tailed distribution of storage times causes the tracer virtual velocity to slow over time, indicated by a sublinear increase in the mean displacement that is predicted by the storage time distribution tail parameter.},

The grain velocity equation agrees well with all experimentally determined velocities of single grains moving over fixed rough beds if a is allowed to vary with bed roughness and saltation height. Values of U*c for such overriding grains are substantially less than normally accepted values. The sediment transport rate equation predicts plane bed experimental data well, over five orders of magnitude of ib. Values of a/tan Î± increase significantly from lower to upper stage plane beds due to an increase in a with suspended sediment concentration but also due to a decrease in tan Î± with increasing transport stage and grain size (as predicted by Bagnold).},

  abstract  = {Models of braided-river deposition must be detailed, fully 3D, and preferably quantitative to be of use in understanding and predicting the nature of ancient deposits. In order to construct and validate adequate predictive models it is necessary to have information on: (1) variation and interaction of channel geometry, water flow and sediment transport in time and space in modern channel belts, as these control erosion and deposition, the formation and migration of channels and bars, and channel abandonment and filling; (2) 3D variation of bed geometry, texture, sedimentary structures and paleocurrents throughout modern channel-belt deposits, including the age and spatial arrangement of preserved parts of bars and channel fills; (3) long-term (more than hundreds of years) trends in channel and floodplain geometry, flow and sedimentary processes in order to understand channel-belt movements such as avulsions, and the spatial arrangement of channel-belt deposits relative to overbank deposits. Such information is rare because: (1) it is difficult to study modern braided-river geometry, flow and sedimentary processes throughout a range of the all-important high discharges; (2) detailed reconstructions of braided channel and bar geometry and movement are only available for the past half-century and cannot readily be linked to causative mechanisms; (3) 3D documentation of modern deposits below the water table (especially large scale features like lateral-accretion bedding) requires extensive coring and dating of the deposits, and geophysical profiling. As a result of this lack of information, and because of the quality of analysis and presentation of the information available, existing braided-river facies models are virtually useless as interpretive and predictive tools. The nature of the information available is critically reviewed. Using information from recent detailed field and laboratory studies of the geometry, flow and sedimentary processes in braided rivers of simple geometry, in single river bends, in channel confluences, and using some theoretical reasoning, it has been possible to construct fully 3D qualitative and quantitative models of braided river deposits. These models can be used to provide sophisticated quantitative interpretations of palaeochannel geometry, hydraulics and migration, as illustrated by comparison with some particularly well described examples of ancient braided river deposits.},

  abstract = {A few decades ago computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was in its infancy. Limitations on memory and computation speed compelled CFD programmers to use single precision values, which was adequate at that time. Through time the computation speed grew exponentially, and prices of memory banks dropped. So, almost naturally the size and complexity of problems in CFD have increased, but the computation precision has not. It appears that for large simulations, up to 100.000 grid points or more, the acquired accuracy is questionable. If in the (near) future increased computation speed would allow even larger simulations, measures should be taken to ensure sufficiently accurate results. Increasing the machine precision would achieve this aim. Furthermore, numerical adaptations might also increase the accuracy. Row-scaling will for instance improve the results of the continuity equation at hardly any expense. Stricter and/or different stopping criteria for iterative processes will surely increase the accuracy in several cases. Several processes, like the turbulence model and the flooding and drying criteria, cause a certain loss of accuracy, which is not always compensated by accuracy improvements. Much could be gained if they were to be improved. An addition to the complexity of CFD in the course of years is the transition from twodimensional to three-dimensional models. Unconditional stability of the scheme for the discretised two-dimensional shallow-water equations seems to have become conditional in the threedimensional case. The numerical stability has become very much dependent on boundary conditions.},

  abstract = {In Europe and North America the prevailing model of â€œnaturalâ€� lowland streams is incised-meandering channels with silt-clay floodplains, and this is the typical template for stream restoration. Using both published and new unpublished geological and historical data from Europe we critically review this model, show how it is inappropriate for the European context, and examine the implications for carbon sequestration and Riverine Ecosystem Services (RES) including river rewilding. This paper brings together for the first time, all the pertinent strands of evidence we now have on the long-term trajectories of floodplain system from sediment-based dating to sedaDNA. Floodplain chronostratigraphy shows that early Holocene streams were predominantly multi-channel (anabranching) systems, often choked with vegetation and relatively rarely single-channel actively meandering systems. Floodplains were either non-existent or limited to adjacent organic-filled palaeochannels, spring/valley mires and flushes. This applied to many, if not most, small to medium rivers but also major sections of the larger rivers such as the Thames, Seine, RhÃ´ne, Lower Rhine, Vistula and Danube. As shown by radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating during the mid-late Holocene c. 4â€“2â€¯ka BP, overbank silt-clay deposition transformed European floodplains, covering former wetlands and silting-up secondary channels. This was followed by direct intervention in the Medieval period incorporating weir and mill-based systems â€“ part of a deep engagement with rivers and floodplains which is even reflected in river and floodplain settlement place names. The final transformation was the â€œindustrialisation of channelsâ€� through hard-engineering â€“ part of the Anthropocene great acceleration. The primary causative factor in transforming pristine floodplains was accelerated soil erosion caused by deforestation and arable farming, but with effective sediment delivery also reflecting climatic fluctuations. Later floodplain modifications built on these transformed floodplain topographies. So, unlike North America where channel-floodplain transformation was rapid, the transformation of European streams occurred over a much longer time-period with considerable spatial diversity regarding timing and kind of modification. This has had implications for the evolution of RES including reduced carbon sequestration over the past millennia. Due to the multi-faceted combination of catchment controls, ecological change and cultural legacy, it is impractical, if not impossible, to identify an originally natural condition and thus restore European rivers to their pre-transformation state (naturalisation). Nevertheless, attempts to restore to historical (pre-industrial) states allowing for natural floodplain processes can have both ecological and carbon offset benefits, as well as additional abiotic benefits such as flood attenuation and water quality improvements. This includes rewilding using beaver reintroduction which has overall positive benefits on river corridor ecology. New developments, particularly biomolecular methods offer the potential of unifying modern ecological monitoring with the reconstruction of past ecosystems and their trajectories. The sustainable restoration of rivers and floodplains designed to maximise desirable RES and natural capital must be predicated on the awareness that Anthropocene rivers are still largely imprisoned in the banks of their history and this requires acceptance of an increased complexity for the achievement and maintenance of desirable restoration goals.},

  abstract  = {This study presents the first detailed field-based analysis of the morphology of bifurcations within anabranching cobble!!e!!gravel rivers. Bifurcations divide the flow of water and sediment into downstream anabranches, thereby influencing the characteristics of the anabranches and the longevity of river islands. The history, morphology, bed grain size, and flow vectors at five bifurcations on the Renous River, New Brunswick, Canada, were studied in detail. The angles of bifurcations within five anabranching rivers in the Miramichi basin were investigated. The average bifurcation angle was 47!!e!!, within the range of values cited for braided river bifurcations. Bifurcation angle decreased when anabranches were of similar length. Shields stresses in channels upstream of bifurcations were lower than reported values for braided rivers. Stable bifurcations displayed lower Shields stresses than unstable bifurcations, contrary to experimental results from braided river bifurcations. Bifurcations in anabranching rivers are stabilized by vegetation that slows channel migration and helps to maintain a uniform upstream flow field. The morphology of stable bifurcations enhances their stability. A large bar, shaped like a shallow ramp that increases in elevation to floodplain level, forms at stable bifurcations. Floodplains at stable bifurcations accrete upstream at rates between 0!!e!!9 and 2!!e!!5 m a!!e!!1. Bars may also form within the entrance of an anabranch downstream of the bifurcation node. These bars are associated with bifurcation instability, forming after a period of stability or an avulsion. Channel abandonment occurs when a bar completely blocks the entrance to one anabranch. The stability of channels upstream of bifurcations and the location of bars at bifurcations influence bifurcation stability and the maintenance of river anabranching in the long term.

Sediment passes through them at the lowest discharges, whereas deposition occurs during the highest discharges. Open-check dams are currently designed based mainly on construction experience. Modeling of hydraulics and bed morphology in check dams involves mixed flows (supercritical and subcritical) as well as discontinuities such as hydraulic jumps. In this paper an unsteady coupled numerical mobile-bed model that can tackle rapid varying flows and discontinuities is applied. The numerical technique is based on the classical staggered grids and implicit integration schemes, together with a proper mass and momentum balance. The 1D numerical model is successfully verified with experimental data of slit-check dams. The applicability of the model in the design of open-check dams is also illustrated.},

  abstract  = {Predicting the frequency and aerial extent of flooding in river valleys is essential for infrastructure design, environmental management, and risk assessment. Conventional flood prediction relies on assumptions of stationary flood distributions and static channel geometries. However, nonstationary flow regimes are increasingly observed and changes in flow and/or sediment supply are known to alter the geometry and flood conveyance of alluvial channels. Systematic changes in flows and/or channel geometry may amplify or attenuate the frequency and/or extent of flood inundation in unexpected ways. We present a stochastic, reduced complexity model to investigate such dynamics. The model routes a series of annual peak discharges through a simplified reach-averaged channel-floodplain cross section. Channel width, depth, and slope are permitted to adjust annually by a user-specified fraction toward equilibrium geometries predicted based on each year's peak discharge and sediment supply. Modeled channel adjustments are compared with empirical observations for two rivers in Minnesota, USA that have experienced multiple large floods over the past 6 years. The model is then run using six hypothetical scenarios simulating nonstationary flow regimes with temporal adjustments in the mean and/or variance of the governing peak-flow distributions. Each scenario is run repeatedly while varying parameters that control the amount of fractional adjustment that channel geometries can make annually. Results indicate that the intra-annual mean horizontal width of floodplain inundation primarily depends on the governing peak-flow distribution's coefficient of variation, but the intra-annual frequency of floodplain inundation (i.e., the fraction of modeled years with inundation) primarily depends on the amount of channel adjustment permitted annually.},

Such models are hierarchically derived from a common and general mathematical framework and then analyzed with a detailed discussion of the physical processes and relevant hypotheses that are involved. Experiments and field data are also used to discuss the related morphodynamic processes. The analysis of the models shows the importance of the closure of secondary currents especially in the modeling of eddy viscosity. This aspect confirms the usefulness of using simplified models for some practical applications, provided the secondary currents are modeled in detail. On the other hand, the free response of the sediments, the phase lag of secondary currents, and the momentum redistribution due to the coupling between the main and the transverse flow are shown to be less relevant. Hence the second-order models, which neglect the effect of superelevation induced by the topography-driven lateral flow on the longitudinal flow, can reasonably be considered a good approximation for both predictive analysis and the computation of the resonant conditions. Finally, the analysis of higher harmonics suggests that the multilobed pattern can intrinsically be present in both second- and fourth-order models.},

  abstract = {Existing numerical river models are mostly built upon asynchronous solution of simplified governing equations. The strong coupling between water flow, sediment transport, and morphological evolution is thus ignored to a certain extent. An earlier study led to the development of a fully coupled model and identified the impacts of simplifications in the water-sediment mixture and global bed material continuity equations as well as of the asynchronous solution procedure for aggradation processes. This paper presents the results of an extended study along this line, highlighting the impacts on both aggradation and degradation processes. Simplifications in the continuity equations for the water-sediment mixture and bed material are found to have negligible effects on degradation. This is, however, in contrast to aggradation processes, in which the errors purely due to simplified continuity equations can be significant transiently. The asynchronous solution procedure is found to entail appreciable inaccuracy for both aggradation and degradation processes. Further, the asynchronous solution procedure can render the physical problem mathematically ill posed by invoking an extra upstream boundary condition in the supercritical flow regime. Finally, the impacts of simplified continuity equations and an asynchronous solution procedure are shown to be comparable with those of largely tuned friction factors, indicating their significance in calibrating numerical river models. It is concluded that the coupled system of complete governing equations needs to be synchronously solved for refined modeling of alluvial rivers.},

  abstract = {This paper presents one of the first dedicated studies on mobile bed hydraulics of dam-break flow and the induced sediment transport and morphological evolution. A theoretical model is built upon the conservative laws of shallow water hydrodynamics, and a high-resolution numerical solution of the hyperbolic system is achieved using the total-variation-diminishing version of the second-order weighted average flux method in conjunction with the HLLC approximate Riemann solver and SUPERBEE limiter. It is found that a heavily concentrated and eroding wavefront first develops and then depresses gradually as it propagates downstream. In the early stage of the dam-break, a hydraulic jump is formed around the dam site due to rapid bed erosion, which attenuates progressively as it propagates upstream and eventually disappears. While the backward wave appears to migrate at the same speed as over a fixed bed, the propagation of the forward wavefront shows a complex picture compared to its fixed-bed counterpart as a result of the domination of rapid bed erosion initially, the density difference between the wavefront and the downstream ambient water in the intermediate period, and the pattern of the deformed bed profile in the long term. It is also found that the free surface profiles and hydrographs are greatly modified by bed mobility, which has considerable implications for flood prediction. The computed wave structure in the intermediate period exhibits great resemblance to available experiments qualitatively, and yet the existence of a shear wave is found in lieu of a secondary rarefaction postulated in an existing analysis. Finally, the use of the complete, rather than simplified, conservation equations is shown to be essential for correct resolution of the wave and bed structures, which suggests that previous models need reformulating.},

  abstract  = {Rivers often witness non-uniform bed load sediment transport. For a long time, non-uniform bed load transport has been assumed to be at capacity regime determined exclusively by local flow. Yet whether the capacity assumption for non-uniform bed load transport is justified remains poorly understood. Here, the relative time scale of non-uniform bed load transport is evaluated and non-capacity and capacity models are compared for both aggradation and degradation cases with observed data. As characterized by its relative time scale, the adaptation of non-uniform bed load to capacity regime should be fulfilled quickly. However, changes in the flow and sediment inputs from upstream or tributaries hinder the adaptation. Also, the adaptation to capacity regime is size dependent, the finer the sediment size the slower the adaptation is, and vice versa. It is shown that the capacity model may entail considerable errors compared to the non-capacity model. For modelling of non-uniform bed load, noncapacity modelling is recommended, in which the temporal and spatial scales required for adaptation are explicitly appreciated.},

While mutual interactions between flow, plant canopy, and morphodynamics have been extensively investigated, similar studies considering plant roots are limited. Here we present results from a numerical model that quantify the feedbacks of both the aboveground and belowground vegetation on gravel bed river morphodynamics. Plant root biogeomorphic feedbacks, that is, uprooting and root-enhanced riverbed cohesion, are quantified through the description of the vertical root distribution. By investigating the evolution of the riverbed of a straight gravel channel with a vegetated patch, we show that uprooting is the primary plant root biogeomorphic feedback determining the evolution of the riverbed and the competing influence of the potential flow erosion versus uprooting depth mediates the plant root controls on morphodynamics. These findings broaden our understanding on the role played by plant roots on gravel bed river morphodynamics.},

  abstract  = {The dynamics of large isolated sand dunes moving across a gravel lag layer were studied in a supply-limited reach of the River Rhine, Germany. Bed sediments, dune geometry, bedform migration rates and the internal structure of dunes are considered in this paper. Hydrodynamic and sediment transport data are considered in a companion paper. The pebbles and cobbles (D50 of 10!!e!!mm) of the flat lag layer are rarely entrained. Dunes consist of well-sorted medium to coarse sand (D50 of 0!!e!!9!!e!!mm). Small pebbles move over the dunes by !!e!!overpassing!!e!!, but there is a degree of size and shape selectivity. Populations of ripples in sand (D50!!e!!<!!e!!0!!e!!6!!e!!mm), and small and large dunes are separated by distinct breaks in the bedform length data in the regions of 0!!e!!7!!e!!1!!e!!m and 5!!e!!10!!e!!m. Ripples and small dunes may have sinuous crestlines but primarily exhibit two-dimensional planforms. In contrast, large dunes are primarily three-dimensional barchanoid forms. Ripples on the backs of small dunes rarely develop to maximum steepness. Small dunes may achieve an equilibrium geometry, either on the gravel bed or as secondary dunes within the boundary layer on the stoss side of large dunes. Secondary dunes frequently develop a humpback profile as they migrate across the upper stoss slope of large dunes, diminishing in height but increasing in length as they traverse the crestal region. However, secondary dunes more than 5!!e!!m in length are rare. The dearth of equilibrium ripples and long secondary dunes is probably related to the limited excursion length available for bedform development on the parent bedforms. Large dunes with lengths between 20!!e!!m and 100!!e!!m do not approach an equilibrium geometry. A depth limitation rather than a sediment supply limitation is the primary control on dune height; dunes rarely exceed 1!!e!!m high in water depths of !!e!!4!!e!!m. Dune celerity increases as a function of the mean flow velocity squared, but this general relationship obscures more subtle morphodynamics. During rising river stage, dunes tend to grow in height owing to crestal accumulation, which slows downstream progression and steepens the dune form. During steady or falling stage, an extended crestal platform develops in association with a rapid downstream migration of the lee side and a reduction in dune height. These diminishing dunes actually increase in unit volume by a process of increased leeside accumulation fed by secondary dunes moving past a stalled stoss toe. A six-stage model of dune growth and diminution is proposed to explain variations in observed morphology. The model demonstrates how the development of an internal boundary layer and the interaction of the water surface with the crests of these bedload-dominated dunes can result in dunes characterized by gentle lee sides with weak flow separation. This finding is significant, as other studies of dunes in large rivers have attributed this morphological response to a predominance of suspended load transport.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of large isolated sand dunes moving across a gravel lag layer were studied in a supply-limited reach of the River Rhine. During daylong surveys, suspended sediment concentration, bedload transport rate, water depth, flow velocity, turbulence intensity, near-bed shear stress and water temperature were recorded over individual isolated dunes. This paper considers the hydrodynamic environment and sediment transport over the dunes. A companion paper details the sedimentology and morphology of the dunes. Flow over the flat gravel lag upstream of large dunes is more uniform than that over dunes, and gravels are rarely entrained by in-bank discharges. Unsteady and non-logarithmic velocity profiles are common within the boundary layer above the stoss side of large dunes, and the near-bed flow demonstrates evidence of large-scale, coherent low-frequency flow structures; these may reflect stacked sequences of separated boundary layers generated by secondary dunes. However, the low-amplitude morphology of large dunes does not affect the statistical properties of turbulence production over the stoss sides. Bed roughness and near-bed shear stress commonly increase steadily over the stoss of dunes, but may decrease near the crest, especially where a crestal platform exists that is devoid of secondary bedforms. Bed roughness scales with the physical size of bed roughness elements. However, variability in roughness lengths is large, owing to the composite nature of bed roughness. Bedload transport over stoss slopes is spatially variable, but often shows an increase with increasing bed shear stress over the stoss. Well-formed wakes only develop downstream of lee slopes, which are close to the angle of repose; otherwise, separation is weak, and suspension and settling of fine sediments is of little consequence to dune evolution. Wake flow is characterized by turbulence production one order of magnitude greater than over the stoss side, which may be related to vortex shedding from the dune. However, wake current speeds are extremely low and variable in direction; reverse flow is not sustained, and no retrogressive bedforms occur in the lee of large dunes. Near-bed shear stress and bed roughness are usually low within the wake, reflecting low current speeds. Weak wake-flow reattachment occurs at a variable distance downstream, up to several times the duneform height. A two-dimensional numerical model for flow over dune topography, calibrated using average parameter values, provided a reasonable description of the flow upstream, and over the backs of large dunes as far as the crestal region. Wake flow could not be modelled. However, the temporal and spatial complexity of natural three-dimensional flow over the dunes resulted in variance in parameter estimates; this variance precluded modelling of flow and bedload transport. Consequently, it was not possible to model dune evolution in a deterministic sense.},

  abstract =  {Determining the hydraulic conditions whereby gravel dunes first develop in subaqueous environments is fundamental as their presence may influence engineering solutions designed to maintain bed stability. In addition, estimates of the flow conditions associated with preserved gravel bed forms in sedimentary sequences are useful for reconstructing the depositional environments and geometries of, for example, oil- and gas-bearing geological strata. Consequently, a series of experiments considered dune initiation. In these experiments, defects and latterly incipient dunes developed from lower-stage plane gravel beds during near-threshold conditions of motion (Î¸/Î¸crit = 1.0â€“1.016) and long periods of marginal bed load transport rates. The three-dimensional defects were almost imperceptible positive ovoid features with heights of one or two grain diameters and lengths and spans of a few decimeters. After 17 hours of flow, incipient, low-amplitude, simple two-dimensional dunes developed from the defects, with heights ranging between 0.029 and 0.055 m, nonequilibrium wavelengths of 1â€“4 m and spans of 0.6â€“0.9 m. Continued development over several days, with Î¸/Î¸crit ratios of around 1.3, resulted in near-equilibrium two-dimensional dunes with wavelengths averaging 2.6â€“3.5 m and spans equal to the flume width (4 m). The inception of incipient dunes could be predicted using bulk flow models; however, this approach was not suitable for the prediction of defect development. Near-bed turbulence, in the form of small-scale sweep events of limited breadth, controls the initiation of defects, but larger-scale, coherent turbulent structures in the outer flow are related to dune development. Significantly, both defects and incipient dunes can exist at the same time, which indicates that the effects of sweeps on the bed morphology persist at the same time as larger-scale turbulent structures are beginning to effect sediment transport.},

The concept is examined in relation to two single thread gravel-bedded streams. One stream is alluvial and free to adjust its geometry whilst in the other, channel capacity and form are partially constrained by cohesive till-banks and a heavily compacted bed.The total quantity of bedload and its calibre were measured for every flood over a six year period, so that the relationship between the grain-size of bedload and the most effective discharge could be examined in the context of thresholds for channel change.The dominant discharge concept was applicable to the alluvial stream in that the bankfull value is an effective discharge for maintaining channel capacity. The concept applied less well to the !!e!!non-alluvial!!e!! stream. Although in both streams the bankfull value was exceeded for less than 0.34 per cent of the time, overbank flows are important in instigating channel change. It is only during overbank flows that the largest bed material is entrained in quantity. For within-channel flows a threshold separates flows which winnow fine matrix from those which entrain the finer bed gravels. This threshold occurred at 60 per cent bankfull.It was concluded that the dominant discharge concept can be applied to streams close to steady-state which are alluvial, competent, and free to adjust their boundaries. An important proviso is that two channel-stability domains can be recognized. These domains represent channel maintenance and channel adjustment and are defined by intrinsic thresholds in the bed material entrainment function.},

  abstract = {Within the framework of the de Saint Venant equations coupled with the Exner equation for morphodynamic evolution, this work presents a new efficient implementation of the Dumbser-Osher-Toro (DOT) scheme for non-conservative problems. The DOT path-conservative scheme is a robust upwind method based on a complete Riemann solver, but it has the drawback of requiring expensive numerical computations. Indeed, to compute the non-linear time evolution in each time step, the DOT scheme requires numerical computation of the flux matrix eigenstructure (the totality of eigenvalues and eigenvectors) several times at each cell edge. In this work, an analytical and compact formulation of the eigenstructure for the de Saint Venantâ€“Exner (dSVE) model is introduced and tested in terms of numerical efficiency and stability. Using the original DOT and PRICE-C (a very efficient FORCE-type method) as reference methods, we present a convergence analysis (error against CPU time) to study the performance of the DOT method with our new analytical implementation of eigenstructure calculations (A-DOT). In particular, the numerical performance of the three methods is tested in three test cases: a movable bed Riemann problem with analytical solution; a problem with smooth analytical solution; a test in which the water flow is characterised by subcritical and supercritical regions. For a given target error, the A-DOT method is always the most efficient choice. Finally, two experimental data sets and different transport formulae are considered to test the A-DOT model in more practical case studies.},

  abstract = {Morphological accelerators, such as the MORFAC (MORphological acceleration FACtor) approach (Roelvink, 2006), are widely adopted techniques for the acceleration of the bed evolution, which reduce the computational cost of morphodynamic numerical simulations. In this work we apply an acceleration to the one-dimensional morphodynamic problem described by the de Saint Venantâ€“Exner model by multiplying all the spatial derivatives related to the mass or momentum flux by an acceleration factor â€¯â‰¥â€¯1 which may be different for each equation. The goal is to identify the best combination of the accelerating factors for which (i) the bed responds linearly to hydrodynamic changes; (ii) a decrease of the computational cost is obtained. The sought combination is obtained by studying the behavior of an approximate solution of the three eigenvalues associated with the flux matrix of the accelerated system. This approach allows to derive a new linear morphodynamic acceleration technique, the MASSPEED (MASs equations SPEEDup) approach, and the a priori determination of the highest possible acceleration for a given simulation. In this new approach both mass conservation equations (water and sediment) are accelerated by the same factor, differently from the MORFAC approach where only the sediment mass equation is modified. The analysis shows that the MASSPEED gives a larger validity range for linear acceleration and requires smaller computational costs than that of the MORFAC approach. The MASSPEED approach is then implemented using an adaptive approach that applies the maximum linear acceleration similarly to the implementation of the Courantâ€“-Friedrichsâ€“-Lewy stability condition. Finally, numerical simulations have been performed in order to assess accuracy and efficiency of the new approach. Results obtained in the long-term propagation of a sediment hump demonstrate the advantages of the new approach. The validation of the method is performed under steady or quasi-steady flow conditions, whereas further investigation is needed to extend morphological accelerators to fully unsteady flows.},

Some of the dangers of using artificial dissipation terms are described, and a weighted-residual tech nique is shown to be very effective.},

  abstract  = {The derivation, application, and validation of a physics-based criterion for selecting between the decoupled (quasi-steady) approach and the coupled (dynamic) approach for modeling morphodynamic processes in alluvial rivers are provided in this paper. A dimensionless parameter ?, which depends on the dynamic relationship between the Froude (Fr) number and the depth-averaged volumetric concentration of total sediment load (Ct), is proposed to represent the relative magnitude between the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic time scales, and therefore, establish a range of applicability of these approaches. It is envisioned that the physics-based criterion presented herein will provide a better understanding of how the ratio of the aforementioned time scales constrains the development and application of morphodynamic numerical models, as well as contribute towards improving assessment and prediction methods that are currently used for evaluating the impact of large-scale practical engineering projects on river corridors (e.g. dam decommissioning and mining-related activities).},

  abstract = {Summary Hydrological simulation of rain-runoff processes is often performed with lumped models which rely on calibration to generate storm hydrographs and study catchment response to rain. In this paper, a distributed, physically-based numerical model is used for runoff simulation in a mountain catchment. This approach offers two advantages. The first is that by using shallow-water equations for runoff flow, there is less freedom to calibrate routing parameters (as compared to, for example, synthetic hydrograph methods). The second, is that spatial distributions of water depth and velocity can be obtained. Furthermore, interactions among the various hydrological processes can be modeled in a physically-based approach which may depend on transient and spatially distributed factors. On the other hand, the undertaken numerical approach relies on accurate terrain representation and mesh selection, which also affects significantly the computational cost of the simulations. Hence, we investigate the response of a gauged catchment with this distributed approach. The methodology consists of analyzing the effects that the mesh has on the simulations by using a range of meshes. Next, friction is applied to the model and the response to variations and interaction with the mesh is studied. Finally, a first approach with the well-known SCS Curve Number method is studied to evaluate its behavior when coupled with a shallow-water model for runoff flow. The results show that mesh selection is of great importance, since it may affect the results in a magnitude as large as physical factors, such as friction. Furthermore, results proved to be less sensitive to roughness spatial distribution than to mesh properties. Finally, the results indicate that SCS-CN may not be suitable for simulating hydrological processes together with a shallow-water model.},

  abstract  = {The Arcachon Lagoon on the French Atlantic coast is a triangular shaped lagoon of 20 km on a side connected to the ocean by a 3-km wide inlet between the mainland and an elongated sand spit. This tidal inlet exhibits a particularly active morphology due to locally strong tidal currents and rough wave conditions. During the past 300 years, minimum and maximum spatial extents of the Cap Ferret sand spit have varied by 8 km while one or two channels have alternately allowed circulation between the lagoon and the ocean. These impressive morphological changes have never prevented regular flushing of the lagoon, eventhough the spit came as close as 300 m from the coast during the 18th century. According to Bruun's concept of tidal inlet stability [Theory and Engineering (1978), 510 pp.], the balance between longshore littoral transport and the tidal prism ensures the perpetuity of the inlet. Process modeling was believed to give better insight into the respective roles of tides and waves in driving the long-term morphological changes of the inlet. A two-dimensional horizontal morphodynamic model was therefore developed, combining modules for hydrodynamics, waves, sediment transport and bathymetry updates. The use of process models at a scale of decades requires a schematization of the input conditions. We defined representative mean annual wave and tide conditions with respect to sediment transport, i.e. conditions that induce the same annual transport as measured in the field. Driven by these representative conditions, simulations run from the 1993 bathymetry show that the tide is responsible for the opening of a new channel at the extremity of the sand spit (where tidal currents are the strongest), while waves induce a littoral transport responsible for the longshore drift of sand bodies across the inlet. One particular simulation consisted in running the model from a hypothetical initial topography where the channels are filled with sand and the entire inlet is set to a constant depth (3 m). The results show the reproduction of a channel and bar system comparable to historical observations, which supports the idea that the lagoon is unlikely to be disconnected from the ocean, provided tide and wave conditions remain fairly constant in the following decades.},

  abstract = {Laboratory experiments were conducted on a sandâ€�gravel Gilbert delta to gain insight on its dynamics under varying base level. Base level rise results in intensified aggradation over the topset, as well as a decrease in topset slope and topset surface coarsening, the signals of which migrate in an upstream direction. Preferential deposition of coarse sediment in the topset results in a finer load at the topsetâ€�foreset break, which creates a fine signature in the foreset deposit. Base level fall has the opposite effects. Entrainment of the topset mobile armor causes a coarsening of the load at the topsetâ€�foreset break and so a coarse signature in the foreset deposit. The entrainment of the topset substrate and fine top part of the foreset may follow, which causes a fining of the load and a fine signature in the foreset deposit. The fact that the upstream sediment supply requires a certain slope and bed surface texture to be transported downstream under quasiâ€�equilibrium conditions counteracts the effects of base level change. This information travels in the downstream direction. In nature base level change is likely so slow that the upstream sediment load maintains the topset slope and bed surface texture and so keeps the topset in a quasiâ€�equilibrium state. Base level change is therefore not expected to leave a clear signal in a mixedâ€�sediment Gilbert delta other than a change in elevation of the topsetâ€�foreset interface.},

  abstract = {This study presents a finite-volume explicit method to solve 2D two-layer shallow water equations. This numerical model is intended to describe two-layer shallow flows in which the superposed layers differ in velocity, density and rheology in a two-dimensional domain. The rheological behavior of mudflow or debris flow is called the Bingham fluid. Thus, the shear stress on rigid bed can be derived from the constitutive equation. The computational approach adopts the HLL scheme, a novel approach for the purpose of computing a Godunov flux and solving the Riemann problem approximately proposed by Harten, Lax and van Leer, as a basic building block, treats the bottom slope by lateralizing the momentum flux, and refines the scheme using the Strang splitting to manage the frictional source term. This study successfully performed 2D two-layer shallow water computations on a rigid bed. The proposed numerical model can describe the variety of depths and velocities of substances including water and mud, when the hyperconcentrated tributary flows into the main river. The analytical results in this study will be valuable for further advanced research and for designing or planning hydraulic engineering structures.},

  abstract = {Non-uniform sediment deposited in a confined, steep mountain channel can alter the bed surface composition. This study evaluates the contribution of geometric and resistance parameters to bed stabilization and the reduction in sediment transport. Flume experiments were done under various hydraulic conditions with non-uniform bed material and no sediment supply from upstream. Results indicate that flume channels respond in a sequence of coarsening and with the formation of bedform-roughness features such as rapids, cascades, and steps. A bedform development coefficient is introduced and is shown to increase (i.e. vertical sinuosity develops) in response to increasing shear stress during the organization process. The bedform development coefficient also is positively correlated with the critical Shields number and Manning×³s roughness coefficient, suggesting the evolution of flow resistance with increasing bedform development. The sediment transport rate decreases with increasing bed shear stress and bedform development, further illustrating the effect of bed stabilization. An empirical sediment transport model for an equilibrium condition is proposed that uses the bedform development coefficient, relative particle submergence (i.e. the ratio of mean water depth and maximum sediment diameter), modified bed slope, and discharge. The model suggests bedform development can play a primary role in reducing sediment transport (increasing bed stabilization). The model is an extension of Lane×³s (1955) relation specifically adapted for mountain streams. These results explain the significance of bedform development in heightening flow resistance, stabilizing the bed, and reducing sediment transport in coarse, steep channels.},

  abstract = {Abstract Shallow two-dimensional turbulent wake flows have been studied experimentally on a large water table. In the experiments, the ambient Reynolds number Reh = UaH/Î½, in which Ua is the depth-averaged ambient velocity, H the water depth, and Î½ the kinematic viscosity, is large, well above a lower critical value of the order of 500 for open-channel flows so that the ambient base flow is fully turbulent. Different types of blunt bodies extending over the full depth are inserted in that base flow, including cylinders and flat solid and porous plates oriented transversely to the ambient flow. In all cases, the transverse body dimension D greatly exceeds the water depthy, DH âª¢ 1. With that condition, the wake Reynolds number Red = UaD/Î½ is very large, greater than 104. The shallow near-wake characteristics of plane wakes from blunt bodies extending over the full water depth have been found to fall into one of three classes: (i) the vortex street (VS) type with an oscillating vortex shedding mechanism, (ii) the unsteady bubble (UB) wake type with flow instabilities growing downstream of a recirculating bubble attached to the body, and (iii) the steady bubble (SB) wake type with an attached bubble followed by a turbulent wake that contains no growing instabilities. When Reh > 1500, the flow classification is uniquely dependent on a shallow wake parameter, S = cfDH in which cf is a quadratic law friction coefficient. For circular cylindrical bodies the VS-UB transition is characterized by a critical value, Sca â‰ˆ 0.2, and the UB-SB transition by Scc â‰ˆ 0.5. Solid plates, oriented transversely, differ by a factor of 1.25. The shallow far-wake behavior has been investigated with a special variable porosity wake device that reduces the wake velocity deficit and completely suppresses the VS instabilities in the near-field. Thus, only UB and SB wake types are found in that case. Furthermore, the shallow plane wake is obsserved to â€œstabilizeâ€� for large downstream distances, xH, in the sense that the growth and maintenance of the large scale structures in the wake flow become suppressed and the wake collapses into a more ordered flow that, however, still contains small scale (of scale H) turbulence. This wake stabilization is controlled by two factors: first, the usual evolution in a turbulent wake that reduces the velocity deficit while increasing the wake parameter S, and secondly, the exponential loss of the momentum deficit flux in the wake due to bottom friction.},

The resulting algorithm also provides a mechanism for controlling the inviscid and viscous time step parameters at very diffusive flows, thereby ensuring rapid convergence for very viscous flows as well as for inviscid flows. Computational capabilities are demonstrated through computation of a wide variety of problems. Convergence rates are shown to be accelerated by as much as two orders of magnitudes, while providing solutions that are indentical to those obtained without preconditioning method.},

Numerical calculations are conducted for four groups of parallel flows with inflectionâ€�point velocity profiles. The necessary conditions for the transverse shear flows to become unstable, so that the largeâ€�scale transverse motion may coexist with the smallâ€�scale bedâ€�generated turbulence, are determined from the calculations. The results are correlated with two dimensionless parameters: a bedâ€�friction number and an ambientâ€�velocity parameter. The bedâ€�friction number quantifies the stabilizing effect of the bedâ€�friction. The ambientâ€�velocity parameter characterizes the changes in depth and roughness across the openâ€�channel flows. In the limiting case of a weak transverse shear flow, when the change in velocity across the flow is small, the bedâ€�friction number becomes the only dimensionless parameter governing the stability of the transverse shear flows. The critical values of this bedâ€�friction number for the weak transverse shear flows with hyperbolicâ€�tangent and hyperbolicâ€�secant velocity profiles, are 0.120 and 0.145, respectively.},

  abstract  = {The morphology of an alluvial river channel affects the movement of water and sediment along it, but in the longer run is shaped by those processes. This interplay has mostly been investigated empirically within the paradigm of Newtonian mechanics. In rivers, this has created an emphasis on equilibrium configurations with simple morphology and uniform steady flow. But transient adjustment, whether between equilibrium states or indefinitely, is to be expected in a world in which hydrology, sediment supply, and base level are not fixed. More fundamentally, water flows and all the phenomena that accompany them are inherently unsteady, and flows in natural channels are characteristically nonuniform. The morphodynamics of alluvial river channels is the striking consequence. In this paper, we develop the essential connection between the episodic nature of bed material transport and the production of river morphology, emphasizing the fundamental problems of sediment transport, the role of bar evolution in determining channel form, the role of riparian vegetation, and the wide range of time scales for change. As the key integrative exercise, we emphasize the importance of physics-based modeling of morphodynamics. We note consequences that can be of benefit to society if properly understood. These include the possibility to better be able to model how varying flows drive morphodynamic change, to understand the influence of the sediments themselves on morphodynamics, and to recognize the inherent necessity for rivers that transport bed material to deform laterally. We acknowledge pioneering contributions in WRR and elsewhere that have introduced some of these themes.},

Syndepositional faults characterized by high rates of vertical motion produced steep coastlines and segmentation of the basin into sub-basins protected from strong longshore and tidal currents. These morphologic conditions, similar to those occurring in fjords, triggered the development of deltaic foreset beds and their extensive progradation. The style of motion of the syndepositional faults controlled the architecture of both the individual fans and the basin infill. In the extension-dominated sector of the Crati Basin, Gilbert-type fan deltas occur as individual fans and show a simple delta foreset unit. In the strike-slip-dominated sector, Gilbert-type fan deltas occur as stacked sequences and commonly show a composite delta foreset unit reflecting persistent large-scale faulting events and repeated source-area uplift and basin-floor subsidence.},

Pioneer plant species that colonize these ecosystems at the landâ€“water interface have developed specific traits in response to environmental constraints (response traits) and are able to modify habitat conditions by modulating geomorphic processes (effect traits). Changes in the geomorphic environment under the control of engineer plants often feed back to organism traits (feedback traits), and thereby ecosystem functioning, leading to eco-evolutionary dynamics. Here we explain the joint foundations of fluvial and coastal ecosystems according to feedback between plants and the geomorphic environment. Location Dynamic fluvial and coastal ecosystems world-wide. Method Drawing from a pre-existing model of â€˜fluvial biogeomorphic successionâ€™, we propose a conceptual framework showing that fluvial and coastal â€˜biogeomorphic ecosystemsâ€™ are functionally similar due to eco-evolutionary feedbacks between plants and geomorphology. Results The relationships between plant traits and their geomorphic environments within different fluvial and coastal biogeomorphic ecosystems are identified and classified within a framework of biogeomorphic functional similarity according to three criteria: (1) pioneer plants develop specific responses to the geomorphic environment; (2) engineer plants modulate the geomorphic environment; (3) geomorphic changes under biotic control within biogeomorphic ecosystems feed back to organisms. Main conclusions The conceptual framework of functional similarity proposed here will improve our capacity to analyse, compare, manage and restore fluvial and coastal biogeomorphic ecosystems world-wide by using the same protocols based on the three criteria and four phases of the biogeomorphic succession model.},

  abstract =  {Experiments are described which have for their object the development of a method of measuring the sand transport in rivers by means of radioactive tracers. The method used is analogous to that which has been used for the measurement of water discharge in which the mean velocity is determined from the rate of displacement of the centroid of a marked cloud of fluid. In these experiments the spread of radioactive sand has been measured from a transverse strip of the bed of a flume in which a steady flow of water and sand is maintained. The distribution of active grains differs from that of a cloud of fluid, however, in that the time scale of the motion is longer due to the slower drift velocity of the particles. Also the particles at low levels in the ripples are at rest for a very much longer time than those in the upper levels so that the spread of the sand particles is much larger than is the case for fluid flow of the same mean velocity and depth. If the motion were allowed to continue for a sufficiently long time it is probable that the distribution would become normal and centred about a point moving with the centroid, but the time for such development would be impracticably long and the transport rate must be deduced from the distributions in the early stages of the motion when the dilution is not very great. In this stage an attempt has been made to explain the shape of the distribution curves in terms of a simple model of the mechanism of transport in which it has been assumed that every particle has an equal chance of moving a certain hop length. Whilst the distributions given by such a model have a general resemblance to those obtained, the similarity is not quantitatively affirmed. A more complicated model which takes into account both the statistical variation of the hop length of the particles and the times that particles spend at different levels in the ripples appears to be necessary. The experiments have shown that the transport rate can be deduced from the mass distribution of tracer particles initially laid to a depth sufficient to cover all levels of movement of the bed ripples, or by measuring the velocity of the centroid of the activity distribution together with an independent measurement of the ripple movements at a point.},

The method is similar in principle to the time-integration method used for measuring the discharge of liquids. The mean velocity of the sand particles can be deduced directly from the measurements. The volume rate of transport can be inferred either by an independent measurement of the thickness of movement of the bed ripples, or by mixing the active sand uniformly with a strip of the bed at the start and measuring the loss of active sand during the experiment. An adequate length must be left between the point of injection and the section at which the passage of tracer is measured. This length depends on the hop lengths of the particles and not on the frequency with which hops are performed.},

  abstract = {The number of bars that form in an alluvial channel cross section can be determined from a physics-based linear model for alluvial bed topography. The classical approach defines separators between ranges in which river planform styles with certain numbers of bars are linearly stable and linearly unstable. We propose an alternative method that is easier to apply. Instead of defining separators between stable and unstable conditions for certain river planform styles, the method directly estimates the most likely number of bars. It is based on a demonstration that conditions of zero spatial damping in a linear model for steady bars are representative for the bar mode that develops inside a river channel. We argue that a method based on steady bars is more appropriate for real rivers than a method based on free migrating bars. We verified the method by applying it to several existing rivers at bankfull conditions. The results are good for width-to-depth ratios up to 100 but deteriorate for higher width-to-depth ratios. We explain the deficiencies for large width-to-depth ratios from the linearity of the model. The results show that our method can be used as a reliable predictor for whether reducing or enlarging the width of a river will lead to a meandering, transition, or braided planform.},

  abstract  = {Sediment often enters rivers in discrete pulses associated with landslides and debris flows. This is particularly so in the case of mountain streams. The topographic disturbance created on the bed of a stream by a single pulse must be gradually eliminated if the river is to maintain its morphological integrity. Two mechanisms for elimination have been identified: translation and dispersion. According to the first of these, the topographic high translates downstream. According to the second of these, it gradually diffuses away. In any given river both mechanisms may operate. This paper is devoted to a description of three controlled experiments on sediment pulses designed to model conditions in mountain streams. Each of the experiments began from the same mobile-bed equilibrium with a set rate and grain size distribution of sediment feed. In one experiment the median size of the pulse material was nearly identical to that of the feed sediment. In the other two the pulse material differed in grain size distribution from the feed sediment, being coarser in one case and finer in the other case. In all cases the mode of pulse deformation was found to be predominantly dispersive, a result that constitutes the main conclusion of this paper. The pulses resulted in a notable but transient elevation of sediment transport rate immediately downstream. When the pulse was coarser than the ambient sediment, the bed downstream remained armored, and a migrating delta formed in the backwater upstream. When the pulse was finer than the ambient sediment, translation was observed in addition to dispersion. The presence of the finer material notably elevated the transport of ambient coarse material on the bed downstream. In part 2 [Cui et al., 2003], the experimental results are used to test a numerical model.},

  abstract  = {Mountain rivers in particular are prone to sediment input in the form of pulses rather than a more continuous supply. These pulses often enter in the form of landslides from adjacent hillslopes or debris flows from steeper tributaries. The activities of humans such as timber harvesting, road building, and urban development can increase the frequency of sediment pulses. The question as to how mountain rivers accommodate pulses of sediment thus becomes of practical as well as academic significance. In part 1 [Cui et al., 2003], the results of three laboratory experiments on sediment pulses are reported. It was found there that the pulses were eliminated from the flume predominantly by dispersion of the topographic high. Significant translation was observed only when the pulse material was substantially finer than the ambient load in the river. Here the laboratory data are used to test a numerical model originally devised for predicting the evolution of sediment pulses in field-scale gravel bed streams. The model successfully reproduces the predominantly dispersive deformation of the experimental pulses. Rates of dispersion are generally underestimated, largely because bed load transport rates are underestimated by the transport equation used in the model. The model reproduces the experimental data best when the pulse is significantly coarser than the ambient sediment. In this case, the model successfully predicts the formation and downstream progradation of a delta that formed in the backwater zone of the pulse in run 3. The performance of the model is less successful when the pulse is composed primarily of sand. This is likely because the bed load equation used in the study is specifically designed for gravel. When the model is adapted to conditions characteristic of large, sand bed rivers with low Froude numbers, it predicts substantial translation of pulses as well as dispersion.},

  abstract  = {Many dams have been removed in the recent decades in the U.S. for reasons including economics, safety, and ecological rehabilitation. More dams are under consideration for removal; some of them are medium to large-sized dams filled with millions of cubic meters of sediment. Reaching a decision to remove a dam and deciding as how the dam should be removed, however, are usually not easy, especially for medium to large-sized dams. One of the major reasons for the difficulty in decision-making is the lack of understanding of the consequences of the release of reservoir sediment downstream, or alternatively the large expense if the sediment is to be removed by dredging. This paper summarizes the Dam Removal Express Assessment Models (DREAM) developed at Stillwater Sciences, Berkeley, California for simulation of sediment transport following dam removal. There are two models in the package: DREAM-1 simulates sediment transport following the removal of a dam behind which the reservoir deposit is composed primarily of non-cohesive sand and silt, and DREAM-2 simulates sediment transport following the removal of a dam behind which the upper layer of the reservoir deposit is composed primarily of gravel. Both models are one-dimensional and simulate cross-sectionally and reach averaged sediment aggradation and degradation following dam removal. DREAM-1 is validated with a set of laboratory experiments; its reservoir erosion module is applied to the Lake Mills drawdown experiment. DREAM-2 is validated with the field data for a natural landslide. Sensitivity tests are conducted with a series of sample runs in the companion paper, Cui et al. (2006), to validate some of the assumptions in the model and to provide guidance in field data collection in actual dam removal projects.},

The primary purposes of the sample runs presented here are to validate some of the assumptions used in the model and to provide guidance as how accurately the field data should be collected. Sample runs indicate that grain size distribution of the reservoir sediment deposit is the most important piece of information needed during the field campaign. Other than the grain size distribution of the reservoir sediment deposit, errors within a reasonable range in other parameters do not result in significant variations in the predicted depositional patterns downstream of the dam, although different magnitudes of sediment deposition may result from such errors. Sample runs also indicate that when the reservoir deposit is composed primarily of gravel, sediment deposition downstream of the dam following dam removal may not propagate far downstream of the dam, and may be limited to isolated reaches where sediment transport capacity is low. Farther downstream sediment deposition becomes progressively smaller due to the attenuation of sediment transport and gravel abrasion. When the reservoir deposit is primarily fine sediment, however, there may be more extensive sediment deposition (both larger area and higher magnitude) downstream of the dam following dam removal. Dredging part of the sediment in advance reduces the downstream impact due to the reduced volume, and the extra distance provided by dredging allows for attenuation of sediment transport. Sample runs with staged dam removal indicate that it provides only limited benefit compared to a one-time removal in case the reservoir deposit is composed primarily of coarse sediment, but may provide significant benefits in case the reservoir deposit is composed primarily of fine sediment. The benefits of a staged removal for the latter case include reduced magnitude and area of deposition as well as reduced suspended sediment concentration downstream of the dam.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents The Unified Gravel-Sand (TUGS) model that simulates the transport, erosion, and deposition of both gravel and sand. TUGS model employs the surface-based bed load equation of Wilcock and Crowe (2003) and links grain size distributions in the bed load, surface layer, and subsurface with the gravel transfer function of Hoey and Ferguson (1994) and Toro-Escobar et al. (1996), a hypothetical sand transfer function, and hypothetical functions for sand entrainment/infiltration from/into the subsurface. The model is capable of exploring the dynamics of grain size distributions, including the fractions of sand in sediment deposits and on the channel bed surface, and is potentially useful in exploring gravel-sand transitions and reservoir sedimentation processes. Simulation of three sets of large-scale flume experiments indicates that the model, with minor adjustment to the Wilcock-Crowe equation, excellently reproduced bed profile and grain size distributions of the sediment deposits, including the fractions of sand within the deposits. Simulation of a flushing flow experiment indicated that the sand entrainment function is potentially capable of simulating the short-term processes such as flushing flow events.},

  abstract = {Because of the combined effects of reduced sediment transport capacity and competency following flow regulation, morphological changes are expected to occur in channels downstream from dams and, specifically, at tributary junctions where local inputs of water and sediment occur. Using a combination of historical aerial photographs, mainstem- and tributary-channel pebble counts, and HEC-RAS flow modeling for two watersheds in south-central VT, one unregulated and the other regulated since 1961, we document the time series of post-regulation channel narrowing and associated bar growth due to the influx of tributary sediment. Channel adjustments at regulated tributary junctions have been significant in ca. 50 years following impoundment, with channels downstream of the confluences narrowing over 15% after an initial ca. 20-year lag before the onset of accelerated narrowing. Moreover, flow modeling suggests that downstream of regulated confluences, the modern median grain size (d50) along the channel bed is immobile. No significant channel narrowing has occurred either above or below unregulated tributary junctions or on the mainstem upstream of regulated confluences. However, greater channel sediment fining is observed upstream of regulated confluences than above unregulated confluences. Thus, the primary mode of mainstem channel adjustment differs up- and downstream of regulated tributaries. These confluence effects have occurred where the tributary drainage area is only 0.2 times that of the mainstem, well below the threshold ratio of 0.6 required for significant geomorphic effects at unregulated confluences, highlighting the geomorphic scale shift of dams. Lastly, we evaluate the downstream length required for a river to recover from the impacts of impoundment and demonstrate that even distal locations are impacted by flow regulation. Unlike the impacts of flow regulation in the western \{US\} where channel incision and bar erosion predominate following impoundment, we find that in situations where bed incision is minimal and where sediment loads are low but bed caliber high, bar growth and channel narrowing are significant adjustments at tributary junctions following impoundment. Therefore, at our sites the effects of dams on reduced competency may be more profound than on reduced sediment transport capacity, highlighting the importance of geologic and geomorphic settings in understanding fluvial responses to impoundment.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate that alluvial channel response to regulation depends on the characteristic mode of sediment transport in a channel and, thus, for a channel in supply-transport equilibrium, on the caliber of sediment mantling the channel bed, as well as changes in characteristic water discharge and sediment load. We find that regulated, coarse gravel- and cobble-bed alluvial rivers dominated by bedload transport are predicted and observed to preserve the value of a dimensionless ratio of characteristic water discharge, channel slope, width, and size of sedimentary particles mantling the bed associated with the critical conditions required for the onset of significant sediment transport. The covariant geomorphic adjustment of such rivers to regulation is independent of the degree of sediment impoundment, although the nature and rate of changes in any specific characteristic appear to be sensitive to changes in sediment supply. In contrast, covariant geomorphic changes in sand- and fine gravel-bed alluvial rivers dominated by weak suspension transport are predicted and observed to be dependent on the degree of sediment impoundment and commensurate with the change in the sediment concentration of characteristic, formative flows. In both cases, specific geomorphic characteristics of alluvial rivers exhibit varied responses to regulation in different rivers, but across all rivers a systematic covariation in channel slope, width, and grain size is observed that, for a given mode of sediment transport, preserves a characteristic value of the Shields number.},

An analysis of an equation for total sediment flux in the limits of suspension-, bedload-, and mixed-modes of transport indicates distinct, steady-state regimes of channel morphology. Such regimes are readily seen in published data for modern alluvial rivers by way of a conventional Shields plot or a plot of channel slope as a function of relative grain size d/h and the ratio ws/u, where d and ws are, respectively, mean diameter and fall speed of bed sediments, and h and u, are, respectively, mean depth and friction velocity of the flow. With slope and mode of transport in an alluvial river constrained by grain size and channel depth alone, estimates of discharge and sediment flux follow directly. Introduction of the sediment flux relationship into conventional diffusion models for the evolution of an alluvial system provides nominal estimates of the response time for channel adjustment to some external changes. For some major modern rivers, this time of response along the entire length of channel is in the range 103�105 yr, underscoring the potential for complicated, long-time interaction of large alluvial systems with, for example, climatic variability.},

  abstract = {The design of local preconditioners to accelerate the convergence to a steady state for the compressible Euler equations has so far been solely based on eigenvalue analysis. However, numerical evidence exists that the eigenvector structure also has an influence on the performance of preconditioners and should therefore be included in the design process. In this paper, we present the mathematical framework for the eigenvector analysis of local preconditioners for the multi-dimensional Euler equations. The non-normality of the preconditioned system is crucial in determining the potential for transient amplification of perturbations. Several existing local preconditioners are shown to possess a highly non-normal structure for low Mach numbers. This non-normality leads to significant robustness problems at stagnation points. A modification to these preconditioners which eliminates the non-normality is suggested, and numerical results are presented showing the marked improvement in robustness.},

  abstract = {Polar temperatures over the last several million years have, at times, been slightly warmer than today, yet global mean sea level has been 6�9?metres higher as recently as the Last Interglacial (130,000 to 115,000 years ago) and possibly higher during the Pliocene epoch (about three million years ago). In both cases the Antarctic ice sheet has been implicated as the primary contributor, hinting at its future vulnerability. Here we use a model coupling ice sheet and climate dynamics�including previously underappreciated processes linking atmospheric warming with hydrofracturing of buttressing ice shelves and structural collapse of marine-terminating ice cliffs�that is calibrated against Pliocene and Last Interglacial sea-level estimates and applied to future greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Antarctica has the potential to contribute more than a metre of sea-level rise by 2100 and more than 15?metres by 2500, if emissions continue unabated. In this case atmospheric warming will soon become the dominant driver of ice loss, but prolonged ocean warming will delay its recovery for thousands of years.},

We re-analyzed his results by simulating the experiments numerically using Delft3D. The bifurcation angles and the roundnesses of the angles in the upstream walls of the channel entrances are found to have a strong effect on flow structure and the division of bedload transport rates over the bifurcated channels. Hence they are key ingredients for the nodal point relations that are used to specify the sediment transport distribution at bifurcations in one-dimensional river models. Other key ingredients are found to be the division of discharges over the bifurcated channels, the widths and average depths of water flowing to the left channel and water flowing to the right channel, the widths of the channel entrances and sediment mobility.},

  abstract = {In the second half of the 19th century, channelization of large multi-thread rivers such as the Rhine, the Danube, and the RhÃ´ne rivers induced artificial disconnection of most of their secondary channels. Compared to naturally abandoned channels, terrestrialization (i.e., the passage from the aquatic to the terrestrial stage, controlled by sediment deposits and/or lowering of the water level) patterns and rates of such artificially prematurely abandoned channels remain largely unknown. Moreover, factors controlling their evolutionary trajectories are complex owing to a set of pressures occurring throughout the 20th century within specific space-time windows. Through a case study of the RhÃ´ne River, this paper aims to assess and distinguish the effects of a set of potential controlling factors on abandoned channel terrestrialization dynamics and lifespan. We tested the influence of: (i) submersible embankments closing the entrance of abandoned channels, (ii) main channel degradation following its channelization or the water level lowering due to channel bypassing in the middle of the 20th century involving drastic water abstraction in these reaches, (iii) transverse dykes within the abandoned channels, (iv) the flooding regime of abandoned channels (i.e., frequency and magnitude of upstream connections producing lotic functioning), and (v) longitudinal variation in the suspended sediment concentration along the main channel. To this end, we studied 24 abandoned channels (16 artificially disconnected at their upstream end by submersible embankments and eight naturally disconnected by bar plug establishment) from the mid-19th to the beginning of the 20th century. Their terrestrialization rates were characterized through the reconstruction of their planimetric trajectories using historical maps and aerial photos. The results reveal a much longer lifespan of artificial abandoned channels compared to natural ones because of the truncation of the initial bedload infilling phase due to the artificial and imposed closing of their entrance. Moreover, terrestrialization occurred faster when water level lowering or channel degradation was greater. Surprisingly, terrestrialization rates were the highest in the most frequently connected artificial abandoned channels (i.e., channels with a high frequency of lotic functioning), probably in relation to the roughness induced by the presence of transversal dykes. Finally, it is difficult to rank all the factors tested because of their complex combinations, which can change in space and time.},

In addition, a numerical method for the computation of the depth-averaged flow field and the bed shear stress (magnitude and direction) is developed. This model has great flexibility of allowable channel geometry. Its results agree better with experimental data if the bed is not flat than in case of a flat bed.},

Transverse convection of momentum by the secondary flow is shown to cause important deformations of the main velocity distribution. The model is also used to investigate simplified computation methods for shallow channels. The usual 'shallow water approximation' is shown to fail here, but a method starting from similarity hypotheses for the main and the secondary flow works well. On the basis of this method, a simplified mathematical model of steady turbulent flow in river bends is developed and verified using the results of laboratory experiments and fully three-dimensional flow computations. This model works well for shallow and mildly curved channels, but it shows important shortcomings if the channel is less shallow or sharplier curved.},

On the basis of hydro-dynamical and micro-mechanical considerations, forces on a solitary sediment particle, resting on a compact bed formed by equal sized sediment particles, under slip-spinning condition were analyzed with the aid of a computational scheme. The experimental data of sediment threshold reported by various investigators were used to calibrate the model making the lift coefficient as a free parameter. An excellent agreement between the present model and the experimental data of uniform sediments was possible owing to the calibration of the model. The computational results are presented in the graphical form where the variation of normalized threshold shear stress with particle Reynolds number for various angles of repose is shown. It is revealed that the threshold shear stress increases with an increase in angle of repose of bed sediment. The results obtained using the present model are compared with the curves proposed by different investigators and also have an agreement with the experimental data of non-uniform sediments. Diagram is presented for the direct estimation of threshold shear stress from the information on sediment size and angle of repose.},

  abstract = {Abstract Bedload transport exhibits considerable spatial and temporal variability, as reflected by large fluctuations of transport rates. Among the various mechanisms proposed for explaining this variability, bedform migration is often cited as the main cause. We took a closer look at this issue by running long-duration experiments in a gravel bed flume using constant water discharge and sediment feed rates. We monitored bed evolution and measured bedload transport rates at the flume outlet using high-resolution techniques. The bed was initially flat, but within a few hours bedforms consisting of alternate bars and pools had developed. The bars exhibited a stick-slip motion: they were stable for long periods but moved episodically (every 10Â hr on average). Their downstream migration produced 36\% of the sediment volume transported, mostly in the form of intense pulses. Much of the transport was caused by the displacement of sediment waves from pool to pool.},

  abstract = {Bed load transport in Muddy Creek, Wyoming, a sandâ€�bedded meandering river with equilibrium bottom topography, was found to consist of a zone of maximum sediment flux that shifted across the channel from near the inside bank in the upstream part of the bend toward the pool at the minimum radius of curvature. Significant net crossâ€�stream transport continued even through the crossings between the bends. The downstream bed load transport field for the bend which was studied in greatest detail was the same as that computed from bed form migration measurements and can be predicted from appropriate boundary shear stress data and the Yalin bed load equation. The zone of maximum bed load transport followed an outwardâ€�shifting region of maximum boundary shear stress, although in the downstream end of the bend the sediment transport maximum tended to stay closer to the centerline than the boundary shear stress maximum due to particle size influences. Net crossâ€�stream transport varied with particle size and was effected by three major processes: topographicallyâ€�induced, nearâ€�bed, crossâ€�stream flow; trough wise flow along obliquely oriented bed forms; and rolling or avalanching of particles on bed form lee faces plus rolling or mass sliding on a steep crossâ€�stream point bar side slope. Coarse particles were carried outward over the top of the point bar by a nearâ€�bed crossâ€�stream flow that was induced by downstream shoaling. These particles then rolled and slid on the point bar side slope and eventually were carried toward the outer bank by troughwise transport along oblique dunes. In the upstream part of the bend, fine particles were carried inward by the channel curvatureâ€�induced, nearâ€�bed flow and by troughwise transport along lee faces of oblique bed forms. Fine particles and coarse particles crossed paths on top of the point bar, where weak troughwise flow moved just the finer particles toward the convex bank, and on the point bar face, where coarse particles rolled against the secondary circuâ€� lation that was carrying the finer particles. Net crossâ€�stream bed load transport was toward the pool and was on average about 10\% of the downstream bed load transport. The Engelund equation predicts reasonably well the general pattern of net crossâ€�stream transport through the meander, but it does not account for the substantial troughwise transport caused by oblique bedforms at several locations in the bend. Our observations suggest that equilibrium bed topography occurs when there is net outward transport into the outward shifting zone of maximum boundary shear stress.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The paper investigates the morphodynamic reaction of a schematic river to a perturbation of the sediment input imposed at its upstream end. The consequent evolution of the initially equilibrium river can be studied by means of various models (0-dimensional; 1-D parabolic and 1-D hyperbolic with uniform sediments; 1-D hyperbolic with graded sediments), depending on the more or less simplified differential equations applied for describing the water and sediment motion. The paper discusses a number of analytical solutions obtained with two types of boundary conditions, namely: (i) stepwise change of the sediment input, very often connected to anthropogenic actions, and (ii) sinusoidal input variation with prescribed period, typically associated to the meteorological cycles (short period) or to the geological and climate change (long period). The solutions provide an explicit expression for the Response Time of the river for the condition (i) and the Attenuation Length of the river for the condition (ii). The two quantities as defined in this paper do have a specific physical meaning, strictly connected with the corresponding boundary conditions, which measures the reactivity of the river to external disturbances. A comparative application of the analytical solutions to various (prevalently large) rivers of the world is given, together with a final discussion.},

This paper examines the transferability of flume results to the field by exploring the extent to which a unified approach to the prediction of (1) flow regime, (2) depth, and (3) total sediment transport can be developed entirely with laboratory data. Relevance vector machine (RVM)-based probabilistic models were constructed with only laboratory data, and their performances were tested against field data and found to be comparable with or better than currently available methods. Comparison of a laboratory-trained RVM with a field-trained RVM suggests that the prediction performances of the two models for unseen field data are not statistically different given the prediction uncertainty. For transferability, the choice of predictor variables is important with successful predictors being characterized by similar probability distribution in the laboratory and field data, e.g., as quantified by the Kullback-Leibler divergence.},

  abstract  = {The Selenga River Delta, Lake Baikal, Russia, is 600 km2 in size and contains multiple distributary channels that receive varying amounts of water and sediment discharge. The delta is positioned along the deep-water (1600 m) margin of Lake Baikal, a half-graben-styled rift basin, qualifying it as a modern analogue of a shelf-edge delta system. This study provides a detailed field survey of channel bed sediment composition, channel geometry, and water discharge. The data and analyses presented here indicate that the Selenga Delta exhibits downstream sediment fining over tens of kilometers, ranging from predominantly gravel (coarse pebble) and sand near its apex to silt and sand at the delta-lake interface. We developed an analytical framework to evaluate the downstream elimination of gravel within the multiple distributary channels. The findings include the following. (1) The Selenga River Delta consists of at least eight orders of distributary channels. (2) With increasing channel order downstream, channel cross-sectional area, width-depth ratio, water discharge, boundary shear stress, and sediment flux systematically decrease. (3) The downstream elimination of gravel in distributary channels is caused by declining boundary shear stress as a result of water discharge partitioning among the bifurcating channels. (4) Over longer time scales, gravel is contained on the delta topset due to frequent and discrete seismic events that produce subsidence and accommodation, so that coarse sediment cannot be transported to the axis of the Baikal Rift basin. The distribution of sediment grain size in deltaic channels, as related to hydrodynamics and sediment transport, plays a critical role in influencing stratigraphy, because the sustained tectonism leads to high preservation potential of the delta topset sedimentary deposits. Therefore, the Selenga River Delta provides an opportunity to explore the interactions between modern deltaic sedimentation processes and tectonics that affect the production of basin stratigraphy.},

  abstract  = {The purpose of this paper is to obtain solutions which are periodic with respect to distance, describing the phenomenon called !!e!!roll-waves, for water flow along a wide inclined channel, and to discuss the behavior of the mathematical solutions. The basic idea presented in Part I is that discontinuous periodic solutions can be constructed by joining together sections of a continuous solution through shocks (or �bores�). It is shown first that no continuous solutions can be periodic and that only one special continuous solution can be used as the basis for constructing discontinuous periodic solutions. The analysis is based upon the non-linear partial differential equations of the !!e!!shallow water theory, augmented by the Cheay formula to allow for turbulent resistance. The Bresse profile equation is obtained in a form applicable for progressing wave flows. Shock conditions are derived for the case of an arbitrary continuous channel bed and for a flow subject to a resisting force. The special continuous solution is explicitly obtained and analyzed. Branches of it are then joined together through shocks. It is proved that roll-waves cannot occur either if the resistance is zero or if the resistance exceeds a certain critical value. As the resistance decreases, the size of the waves decreases also; and if the resistance becomes too large, the profiles reverse their direction and can no longer be joined by shocks. This critical value is reached when the (dimensionless) resistance coefficient equals one-fourth the value of the channel slope. The presence of a resistance force which varies merely with velocity is not sufficient to permit the construction of periodic solutions; the resistance must also act in such a manner that it decreases as the water depth increases. The analysis proves that the ratio of wave height to wave length of roll-waves is always independent of the speed of the waves. Explicit expressions for water height and shock height as functions of wave length are derived. The investigation studies the static discharge rate as a function of the wave speed, and asymptotic formulas for the wave speed in terms of the average discharge rate are derived. Twelve sets of curves arc presented, based on the equations obtained here, to illustrate the quantitative behavior of roll-waves; these may be used to check this theory against observed data. For prescribed values of slope, resistance, and wave speed, there is a one-parameter family of roll-wave solutions. If the wave length is also prescribed, the solution will then be unique.},

  abstract  = {This paper is to report a newly developed numerical-empirical model, the Enhanced CCHE2D (EnCCHE2D), and its application to simulating the alluvial channel migration phenomena. EnCCHE2D model is capable of predicting quasi-three-dimensional (3D) flow field and shear stress distribution on the bed, because a set of empirical functions of 3D flow characteristics formulated by results of a 3D model, CCHE3D, was integrated with CCHE2D, a depth-averaged hydrodynamic model, the predecessor of EnCCHE2D. The processes of sediment transport and meander migration were predicted based on these quasi-3D flow solutions. The advance or retreat of bank is calculated by considering not only the hydraulic erosion of bank surface and toe, but also the mass balance of sediment flux in the near-bank zone. As a result, the simulation of bank erosion, bar/pool formation and shifting, bank advance and retreat, channel widening and migration and meander evolution phenomena agree well with the available measurements of physical experiments.},

  abstract = {This paper reports the development of an enhanced two-dimensional (2D) numerical model for the simulation of flow hydrodynamics and mass transport in meandering channels. The hydrodynamic model is based on the solution of the depth-averaged flow continuity and momentum equations where the density of flow varies with the concentration of transported mass. The governing equation for mass transport model is the depth-averaged convection and diffusion equation. The dispersion terms arisen from the integration of the product of the discrepancy between the mean and the actual vertical velocity distribution were included in the momentum equations to take into account the effect of secondary current. Two laboratory experimental cases, flow in mildly and sharply curved channels, were selected to test the hydrodynamic model. The comparison of the simulated velocity and water surface elevation with the measurements indicated that the inclusion of the dispersion terms has improved the simulation results. A laboratory experiment study of dye spreading in a sine-generated channel, in which dye was released at the inner bank, centerline, and outer bank, respectively, was chosen to verify the mass transport model. The simulated concentration field indicated that the Schmidt number can be used as a calibration parameter when dispersion is computed using a 2D approach with a simplified turbulence model.},

  abstract = {Summary A two-dimensional depth-averaged hydrodynamic model is developed to simulate the evolution of meandering channels from the complex interaction between downstream and secondary flows, bed load and suspended sediment transport, and bank erosion. The depth-averaged model calculates both bed load and suspended load assuming equilibrium sediment transport and simulates bank erosion with a combination of two interactive processes: basal erosion and bank failure. The mass conservation equation is solved to account for both vertical bed-elevation changes as well as lateral migration changes when sediment is removed through basal erosion and bank failure. The numerical model uses deformable elements and a movable grid to simulate the gradual evolution of a near-straight deformable channel into a highly sinuous meandering channel. The model correctly replicates the different phases of the evolution of free meandering channels in experimental laboratory settings including: (1) downstream and upstream migration; (2) lateral extension; and (3) rotation of meander bends.},

Recently numerous numerical simulations are performed using two-dimensional morphodynamic model for bed and bank with consideration of effects of slump blocks. Four different cases are simulated separately for steady and unsteady flow condition for about 6Â h with and without slump block consideration. The measured bank erosion, channel migration and the channel width evolution show significant difference in the results due to inclusion of slump block effects. Long term simulation has been performed for 24Â h to predict the free meandering behavior with variation of different slump block parameters. The result shows clear bar formation and projection, channel formation and migration towards the outer bends, making longer length of the flow path and increasing the sinuosity with the time which is very similar with the natural rivers.},

  abstract = {We propose a simple extension of the well-known Riemann solver of Osher and Solomon (Math. Comput. 38:339--374, 1982) to a certain class of hyperbolic systems in non-conservative form, in particular to shallow-water-type and multi-phase flow models. To this end we apply the formalism of path-conservative schemes introduced by Par{\'e}s (SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 44:300--321, 2006) and Castro et al. (Math. Comput. 75:1103--1134, 2006). For the sake of generality and simplicity, we suggest to compute the inherent path integral numerically using a Gaussian quadrature rule of sufficient accuracy. Published path-conservative schemes to date are based on either the Roe upwind method or on centered approaches. In comparison to these, the proposed new path-conservative Osher-type scheme has several advantages. First, it does not need an entropy fix, in contrast to Roe-type path-conservative schemes. Second, our proposed non-conservative Osher scheme is very simple to implement and nonetheless constitutes a complete Riemann solver in the sense that it attributes a different numerical viscosity to each characteristic field present in the relevant Riemann problem; this is in contrast to centered methods or incomplete Riemann solvers that usually neglect intermediate characteristic fields, hence leading to excessive numerical diffusion. Finally, the interface jump term is differentiable with respect to its arguments, which is useful for steady-state computations in implicit schemes. We also indicate how to extend the method to general unstructured meshes in multiple space dimensions. We show applications of the first order version of the proposed path-conservative Osher-type scheme to the shallow water equations with variable bottom topography and to the two-fluid debris flow model of Pitman {\&} Le. Then, we apply the higher-order multi-dimensional version of the method to the Baer--Nunziato model of compressible multi-phase flow. We also clearly emphasize the limitations of our approach in a special chapter at the end of this article.},

  abstract = {The Bulle effect is a phenomenon in which a disproportionately higher amount of near-bed sediment load at a fluvial diversion moves into the diverted channel, even for cases in which the proportion of water (with respect to the main flow) entering the diversion channel is relatively small. This phenomenon has wide-ranging implications for both engineered and natural systems: from efficient design of channels to redirect water and sediment for reclaiming sinking deltas, designing navigational channels that do not need frequent dredging, to morphological evolution of river bifurcations. The first ever, and one of the most extensive set of experiments conducted to explore this phenomenon, were conducted by Bulle in . In the current study the experiments conducted by Bulle have been simulated using an open-source, free-surface finite-element-based hydrodynamic solver. The main objectives were to explore to what extent the complex phenomenon of the Bulle effect at the scale of a laboratory experiment can be simulated accurately using Reynolds-averaged Navier!!e!!Stokes (RANS)-based hydrodynamic solver, and to understand the details of the hydrodynamics that Bulle could not analyze through his experiments. The hydrodynamics captured by the simulations were found to match the observations made by Bulle through his experiments, and the distributions of sediment at the diversion predicted by the numerical simulations were found to match the general trend observed in the laboratory experiments. The results from the numerical simulations were also compared with existing one-dimensional models for sediment distribution at bifurcations, and the three-dimensional numerical model was found to perform appreciably better. This is expected due to the complex flow features at the diversion, which can only be captured satisfactorily using a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model.

  abstract = {When studying bifurcating space-periodic solutions one often has a situation, common in many problems of fluid dynamics, in which in the R-k plane (R a control parameter such as Reynolds number, k wave number) the passage from linear stability to instability is characterized by a parabola-like curve, having a minimum at Rc, kc. We analyse classes of problems in which the coefficients of nonlinear terms in the amplitude equation go through zero near kc. Various examples of such degenerate problems can be found in the literature, but have not been studied yet. We give an extensive classification of bifurcation pictures, which display rather unusual behaviour. We further study the stability of these periodic solutions subject to quite general perturbation. We find as a general result that all bifurcating solutions are unstable except for a small neighbourhood of a curve Î“ in the R-k plane. There is hence a strong selection mechanism of (periodic) patterns, which fixes, for each value of R, with a very small uncertainty, the wave number of the stable bifurcating periodic solution. For one class of problems the curve Î“ continues to exist for all values of R for which our theory is consistent. For another class the curve stops at a value Râˆ— > Rc. For R > Râˆ— all bifurcating periodic solutions are unstable. In this case instability provides a mechanism of rejection of all periodic patterns. In the last section we analyse the particular case of the Blasius boundary-layer flow.},

The origin and stability of these asymmetrical fine-grained cohesive bifurcations are investigated here using Delft3D, a morphodynamic flow and sediment transport model. Results are compared to bifurcations on the Mossy delta, Saskatchewan, Canada, that have remained stable for decades. Over a range of channel aspect ratios, friction factors, and Shields numbers, we find three equilibrium functions relating the discharge ratio of the bifurcate arms at equilibrium to the Shields number. One function defines symmetrical configurations (equal partitioning of discharge), while the other two define asymmetrical configurations (unequal partitioning of discharge). Discharge asymmetries and morphologies of Mossy delta bifurcations are consistent with these predictions. Among the equilibrium bifurcations, only the asymmetrical type is stable to perturbations, such as a partial closing of one throat. This possibly explains why asymmetrical bifurcations are more common in nature.},

We develop a geometric model that predicts the occurrence of each delta type by calculating the topset and foreset thicknesses under different fluvial and basinal conditions. Our model predicts that topset-dominated deltas have a novel characteristic: their distributary channels commonly incise into pre-delta sediment. This type of delta should be common on shelves where the slope is less than !!e!!0.05!!e!! and the river feeding the delta has a discharge greater than !!e!!200 m3/s. Field data from Gulf of Mexico deltas confirm the prediction that distributary channels often incise into pre-delta sediment. Finally, we propose a new stratigraphic model for topset-dominated deltas and suggest that future stratigraphic interpretation must distinguish between delta types because the cause of channel incision for each is different and may be unrelated to allogenic changes.},

  abstract = {Problems pertaining to the transportation of sediment by flowing water have been extensively studied by engineers and scientists during the last few years. Most of the various experiments have been concerned with either bed-load or suspended load, but seldom have they been studied simultaneously.When bed-load and suspended load occur simultaneously in a flume or stream a distinct difference in their mechanical composition is often observed. A curve fitted to the plotted data from a mechanical analysis of the bed-material shows a distinct break. This break occurs most commonly in the data plotted from samples taken in mountain streams where the bed-material is extremely coarse. For instance, in the Rhine River, Switzerland [see 5 of �References� at end of paper] the bed-material ranges in size from pebbles 5 mm in diameter to boulders 100 mm in diameter and greater. Between boulders and in protected pools, however, sand one mm in diameter and finer is found, whereas particles ranging in size from one to five mm are not present. The explanation for this size-distribution has been that the material greater than five mm in diameter moves as bed-load and the material finer than one mm in diameter moves as suspended load. Particles ranging in size from one ram to five mm in diameter occur rarely for certain geologic or hydraulic reasons [3].},

The first type occurs when the Froude number of the flow is close to 1 and the ratio between the depth and the width of the flow is within a certain range. This pattern probably results from surface waves on the water. The second type of pattern has alternating scour holes and occurs predominantly when water is flowing between rough banks. It is shown how this pattern can be caused by the difference between the shear stresses at the two sides of the flow cross section.},

  abstract  = {Effectiveness in geomorphology may be associated with transport (work) and with landform. Bedload transport may relate to both. Determination of that discharge which transports more bedload than any other entails assessment of the magnitude and frequency of bedload transport. This involves arraying daily mean discharges, computing the bedload for each unit of discharge, and determining the discharge that transports the most bedload. For those rivers in which the relationships of bedload discharge to water discharge are not dominated by very large-size particles and where daily mean discharges are an adequate description of streamflow characteristics, a large body of data demonstrates that this discharge is often analogous to bankfull discharge and often has a frequency of recurrence of one to two years.Rivers with constraints on the mobility of bed material, typically armoured channels with steeper than average relationships of bedload discharge to water discharge, may have an effective discharge occurring at higher stages and greater recurrence intervals than bankfull discharge. Bedload discharges were measured at five snow-melt dominated, gravel-bedded rivers in the northern Rocky Mountains, USA; drainage areas at the sites ranged from about 55 to 4950 km2 and bankfull discharges ranged from about 6-5 to 650 m3 s-1. Median bed-surface particles, d50, ranged from 40 to 173 mm, and d90 ranged from 132 to 310 mm. Exponents of the bedload ratings, indicating the steepness of the relationship of bedload discharge to water discharge, ranged from 2!!e!!30 to 5!!e!!06. Values of the exponent correlated well with values of either d50 or d90 of the bed-surface material and demonstrate the effect of the bed-surface material on the bedload rating. Effective discharge was determined for each site. The ratio of effective discharge to bankfull discharge, Qe/Qb, ranged from 0!!e!!98 to 1!!e!!31. The values of Qe/Qb correlated well with exponent values from the bedload ratings. Data indicate that, as the exponent of the bedload rating increases from typical to more steep values, effective discharge increases from near-bankfull discharge to, in the present study, about 1!!e!!3 bankfull discharge. This represents about a doubling of the recurrence interval. Copyright !!e!! 2001 John Wiley  \&  Sons, Ltd.},

It is concluded that the helical motion introduced by the channel curvature may be fairly well described. The results are then applied to the more complex problem of flow in a river bend with movable bed. Next, the problem of flow in a meandering channel with fixed side walls has been investigated, using a special system of curvilinear coordinates. The solution of the linearized flow equations yields a method for calculation of the distribution of the bed shear stress. In the first approximation the large-scale bottom geometry is calculated by considering the lateral sediment balance. The helical flow will move the sediment particles towards the curvature center, while the transverse slope of the bed will give a movement in the opposite direction.},

The computational time of each test case using different schemes is obtained and the speedups are reported for different number of grid points. Also, two different GPUs are utilized and an occupancy analysis is performed for each of the GPUs. The numerical experiments show the speedups for the WENO schemes are more than that of the first-order upwind scheme and are very promising. Furthermore, the occupancy analysis indicates the occupancy is optimal for the presented simulations.},

Particular attention has been paid to the numerical treatment of the convective accelerations where, as a result of narrow harbour entrances and the general nature of planform geometries, the resulting highly non-uniform flow fields can readily lead to non-linear instabilities and unstable numerical solutions. In order to check the validity of the numerical results, a comprehensive study was carried out to compare, with scaled laboratory model studies, the predicted tidal velocity fields and flushing characteristics for a number of rectangular harbours of constant planform area but different length to breadth ratios. The experimentally measured average per cycle exchange coefficients and the observed mean water level path-lines agreed reasonably well with the corresponding numerically predicted exchange coefficients and depth averaged velocity fields. The results of both the numerical and laboratory model studies confirmed conclusively that the maximum gross flushing characteristics occurred within a rectangular harbour when the length to breadth ratio was close to unity. Also, further tests showed that the insertion of impermeable barriers as a possible means of increasing the flushing efficiency proved to be unsatisfactory.},

  abstract = {Abstract Bed load transport is a highly stochastic, multiscale process, where particle advection and diffusion regimes are governed by the dynamics of each sediment grain during its motion and resting states. Having a quantitative understanding of the macroscale behavior emerging from the microscale interactions is important for proper model selection in the absence of individual grainâ€�scale observations. Here we develop a semimechanistic sediment transport model based on individual particle dynamics, which incorporates the episodic movement (steps separated by rests) of sediment particles and study their macroscale behavior. By incorporating different types of probability distribution functions (PDFs) of particle resting times , under the assumption of thinâ€�tailed PDF of particle velocities, we study the emergent behavior of particle advection and diffusion regimes across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. For exponential PDFs of resting times , we observe normal advection and diffusion at long time scales. For a powerâ€�law PDF of resting times (i.e., ), the tail thickness parameter is observed to affect the advection regimes (both sub and normal advective), and the diffusion regimes (both subdiffusive and superdiffusive). By comparing our semimechanistic model with two random walk models in the literature, we further suggest that in order to reproduce accurately the emerging diffusive regimes, the resting time model has to be coupled with a particle motion model able to produce finite particle velocities during steps, as the episodic model discussed here.},

By deploying both numerical simulations and flume experiments, the emergent particle diffusion regimes for both uniform and mixed tracer particles were studied and compared. For uniform particles, power-law-distributed resting times Tr produced super-, sub- or normal diffusion regimes for certain values of the tail exponent Î½. Based on the assumption that heterogeneity in particle size leads to a power-law distribution of Tr, a completely different diffusion regime emerges in mixtures compared with those obtained from uniform particles with the same value of the tail exponent Î½. Mixtures exhibited the same ballistic regime (the variance of travel distance grows as time squared) for different values of Î½, and ballistic regimes for mixtures also emerged from several other tested models. Furthermore, our experimental results confirmed the ballistic regime; however, the decreasing number of tracked particles may result in apparent but deceptive sub-diffusion. We conclude that ballistic regimes for mixtures result from violations of the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumptions, attributing to downstream sorting processes.},

  abstract =  {A high-resolution data set obtained from high-speed imaging of coarse sand particles transported as bed load allows us to confidently describe the forms and qualities of the ensemble distributions of particle velocities, accelerations, hop distances, and traveltimes. Autocorrelation functions of frame-averaged values (and the decay of these functions) support the idea that the forms of these distributions become time invariant within the 5!!e!!s imaging interval. Distributions of streamwise and cross-stream particle velocities are exponential, consistent with previous experiments and theory. Importantly, streamwise particle velocities possess a !!e!!light!!e!!tail, where the largest velocities are limited by near-bed fluid velocities. Distributions of streamwise and cross-stream particle accelerations are Laplace in form and are centered on zero, consistent with equilibrium transport conditions. The majority of particle hops, measured start to stop, involve short displacements, and streamwise hop distances possess a Weibull distribution. In contrast to previous work, the distribution of traveltimes is exponential, consistent with a fixed temporal disentrainment rate. The Weibull distribution of hop distances is consistent with a decreasing spatial disentrainment rate and is related to the exponential distribution of traveltimes. By taking into account the effects of experimental censorship associated with a finite sampling window, the relationship between streamwise hop distances and traveltimes, , likely involves an exponent of !!e!! !!e!! 2. These experimental results!!e!!an exponential distribution of traveltimes Tp and a Weibull distribution of hop distances Lx with shape parameter k < 1!!e!!are consistent with a nonlinear relationship between these quantities with !!e!! > 1.},

  abstract = {Braided rivers produce flow confluences and divergences (diffluences) in roughly equal numbers, but braided river research has focused mainly on confluences. Divergences, however, are of equal importance dynamically: they are sites of formation of central bars and the development of flow divisions that can steer the flow toward one part of the braided network or another. In a series of experiments on flow in isolated, well-defined bifurcations, we found that although a central bar always develops, the divided flow may continue to flow on both sides of the bar (!!e!!stable bifurcation) or may eventually be forced entirely to one side of the bar or the other (!!e!!unstable!!e!! bifurcation). We found that an unstable bifurcation forms when the flow field is characterized by both a low Shields stress and a nonuniform incoming flow. We also found that divergences with erodible banks tend to an equilibrium configuration that depends mainly on the widening ratio of the channel.},

He ignored the degree of exposure of individual grains as a separate parameter. This report describes experiments to measure the dimensionless threshold stress and its dependence on grain protrusion, which was found to be very marked. The threshold stress for grains resting on the top of an otherwise flat bed in a turbulent stream was measured and found to be 0.01-considerably less than previously-reported values of 0.03-0.06 for beds where all grains were at the same level. It is suggested that the new lower value be used in all turbulent flow situations where the bed is of natural sediments or unlevelled material. An hypothesis is proposed that the conventional Shields diagram implicitly contains variation with protrusion between the two extremes of (i) large grains and large Reynolds numbers, with small relative protrusion, and (ii) small grains, low Reynolds numbers, and protrusion of almost a complete grain diameter. In view of this, the extent of the dip in the Shields plot is explicable in that it represents a transition between two different standards of levelling as well as the transition between laminar and turbulent flow past the grains, the range of which it overlaps considerably.},

  abstract = {Tracer pebbles are widely used to learn about gravel transport along rivers. Movement over short times and distances is dominated by factors controlling entrainment: relative particle size and shear stress. Movement at longer scales also involves depositional factors: burial and reexposure and exchange between channels, bars, and other depositional environments. We mapped mixed-size tracers in six reaches of a small Scottish river after 2 and 8 years to investigate differences in relative and absolute mobility and infer the importance of burial and exchange. Patterns of relative mobility according to size and shear stress, both within and between reaches, did not change significantly. Some local bunching of tracers was apparent in both surveys, with redistribution from pools into riffles and bars. The main change was that virtual velocities were âˆ¼50\% lower, and estimated gravel fluxes were also lower, in the longer term. This slowdown is attributed to vertical mixing giving decreased mobility as surface-seeded tracers become buried, long-term storage in bars and other less active parts of the system, and in this channel, advection of tracers downstream onto a finer bed giving higher relative size.},

  abstract = {Gradual downstream fining along gravel-bed rivers is often followed by a relatively abrupt change to a sand bed. This has usually been explained by the breakdown of pebbles of certain lithologies to sand, but it is not restricted to particular rock types and can occur over distances too short for significant abrasion. An alternative explanation is that as shear stress declines downstream, size sorting is enhanced through nonlinearities and thresholds in bedload transport and deposition mechanisms. This hypothesis is tested by numerical modeling of an idealized channel with a mixed gravel and sand bed. Abrupt and persistent gravel fronts with associated breaks of slope develop from a range of smooth initial states when a new initial-motion equation is used, but not with a conventional equation. The results suggest an emergent phenomenon, but one that is sensitive to process specification rather than initial or boundary conditions.},

  abstract = {Alternative general forms are considered for equations to predict mean velocity over the full range of relative submergence experienced in gravel- and boulder-bed streams. A partial unification is suggested for some previous semiempirical models and physical concepts. Two new equations are proposed: a nondimensional hydraulic geometry equation with different parameters for deep and shallow flows, and a variable-power resistance equation that is asymptotic to roughness-layer formulations for shallow flows and to the Manning-Strickler approximation of the logarithmic friction law for deep flows. Predictions by existing and new equations using D84 as roughness scale are compared to a compilation of measured velocities in natural streams at relative submergences from 0.1 to over 30. The variable-power equation performs as well as the best existing approach, which is a logarithmic law with roughness multiplier. For predicting how a known or assumed discharge is partitioned between depth and velocity, a nondimensional hydraulic geometry approach outperforms equations using relative submergence. Factor-of-two prediction errors occur with all approaches because of sensitivity to operational definitions of depth, velocity, and slope, the inadequacy of using a single grain-size length scale, and the complexity of flow physics in steep shallow streams.},

We simulate the response using a 1-D multigrain size morphodynamic model. Since premining conditions are unknown and modern data are insufficient for tuning the process representation, we devised a novel modeling strategy which may be useful in other data-poor applications. We start the model from a smoothed version of the modern longitudinal profile with bed grain size distributions optimized to match alternative assumptions about natural sediment supply and compare runs that include mining with control runs that can be used to quantify the effects of deficiencies in process representation and initialization. Simulations with an appropriate choice of natural supply rate closely match the best available test data, which consist of a detailed 1952!!e!!1999 gravel budget for the distal part of the model domain. The simulations suggest that the main response to mining was rapid bed fining, which allowed a major increase in bed load transport rate with only slight (~0.1!!e!!m) mean aggradation within the mining region and most of the excess sediment exported well beyond the mountain front within the mining period or soon afterward. We compare this pattern of response by a large, powerful river with previous case studies of river adjustment to sediment supply change.},

This decline in slope is associated with rapid downstream fining of the gravel bed followed by an abrupt transition to a sand bed. The channel pattern alters progressively rather than abruptly, in the sequence (1) near-braided, (2) meandering with active point-bar chutes, (3) meandering with active outer-bank talweg, (4) stable equiwidth sinuous. The changes in channel pattern and hydraulic geometry are predicted better by rational approaches based on critical shear stress or other physical concepts than by purely empirical discriminant or trend equations. Measurements in five reaches confirm a downstream decrease in shear stress and the amount and calibre of bedload. It is argued that the downstream changes in channel character in this stream are induced by profile concavity inherited from deglacial conditions, are typical of many streams in mountainous areas and can be understood in terms of slope-induced changes in hydraulic properties.},

We describe pronounced fining over a short distance in a Scottish river that has no human disturbance or lateral input of water and sediment. Measured abrasion rates are far too small to explain observed downstream fining, but bed-load trap measurements and the dispersion of magnetic tracer pebbles in six subreaches both show sorting during transport. The observed downstream fining is also simulated well by a numerical sediment routing model using hydraulic and transport laws consistent with our field measurements. The geomorphological cause of the strong fining is slope reduction above a local base-level control. In this common situation the development of downstream fining is part of the river's tendency to minimize downstream variation in bed-load transport rates, and can proceed far more rapidly than the major aggradation otherwise required for equilibration.},

In these circumstances the accommodation space and the sediment supply increased throughout time. This determined the development of the coarsening and thickening upward megasequence, resulting from the vertical stacking of four smaller sequences which, in turn, were built up by stacking of Gilbert-type fan-delta units and were bounded by calcarenite facies deposited on a shallow shelf.This sequential organisation and internal structure were controlled by the tectonic behaviour of the faults on the basin margin, in particular large-scale movements with intervals of stability, which respectively created accommodation space for the deltaic sequences and conditions for development of calcarenite shelf facies.},

El estudio de estos sistemas en derivadas parciales, que entran dentro de los llamados sistemas hiperb�licos, han sido ampliamente desarrollados, debido a su gran n�mero de aplicaciones pr�cticas, bien sean aplicaciones industriales o de estudio de fen�menos naturales. Al no conocerse t�cnicas de resoluci�n exactas, es necesario el uso de m�todos num�ricos que aproximen a la soluci�n del problema planteado. En este punto hay que distinguir el caso homog�neo (segundo miembro nulo) del no homog�neo, en el cual aparecen t�rminos fuente en el segundo miembro. Son muchos los m�todos num�ricos desarrollados para el caso homog�neo, basado en t�cnicas de discretizaci�n estables y precisas. Estos m�todos, se han usado en muy diversas aplicaciones pr�cticas con �xito, especialmente en din�mica de gases. El problema se encuentra cuando el sistema no es homog�neo, es decir, tenemos t�rminos fuente. Este es, t�picamente, el caso de las ecuaciones de aguas someras. En este caso, la aplicaci�n de las t�cnicas desarrolladas para sistemas homog�neos al tratamiento de t�rminos fuente, proporciona soluciones con muy altos errores. Trabajos anteriores han conseguido extender algunos m�todos al tratamiento de t�rminos fuente. La clave est� en aproximar, al menos con segundo orden, ciertas soluciones estacionarias de la ecuaci�n no homog�nea. En este trabajo abordamos el problema de la extensi�n sistem�tica de esquemas para sistemas hiperb�licos no homog�neos. En concreto, introducimos el concepto de equilibrado asint�tico y probamos que los esquemas propuestos equilibran al sistema, para las soluciones estacionarias, sobre un conjunto cuya medida tiende a cero cuando lo hace el paso de la malla en espacio. Tambi�n se presentan varios resultados de equilibrado exacto sobre los nodos de la malla. Aplicamos las t�cnicas desarrolladas para el tratamiento de t�rminos fuente al caso de las ecuaciones de aguas someras. En el caso monodimensional, se estudian los t�rminos fuente debidos a variaci�n de fondo, variaci�n de anchura y t�rminos de fricci�n. Por otro lado, vemos c�mo la t�cnica presentada se puede aplicar de forma natural a sistemas hiperb�licos no homog�neos con t�rminos no conservativos. Se aplican los esquemas propuestos a las ecuaciones de aguas someras bicapa, que modelan flujos con dos capas de distinta densidad. Los procesos de mezcla que se pueden producir entre las dos capas del flujo hacen que los esquemas, cuando aparecen este tipo de fen�menos, sean incondicionalmente inestables. Se ha propuesto una t�cnica para estabilizar el esquema. Igualmente se prueba que son asint�ticamente equilibrados y se obtienen resultados de equilibrado exacto sobre los nodos de la malla. Para modelos bidimensionales se utilizan m�todos de tipo l�nea, los cuales se definen a partir de problemas monodimensionales proyectados. Se aplican a las ecuaciones de aguas someras bidimensionales, estudi�ndose tambi�n varios resultados de equilibrado y estabilidad de los esquemas. Finalmente, se utilizan las t�cnicas presentadas para la simulaci�n de la cat�strofe ecol�gica que tuvo lugar en 1998, debido a la rotura de las balsas de Aznalc�llar},

  abstract = {Dam removal is commonly used for river restoration. However, there are still some uncertainties associated with dam removal, mainly related to the sediment transport rates released downstream from the deposit that had previously filled the impoundment. This research studies the physical response to dam removal in the antecedent deposit by answering the following questions: (a) how does an initial channel excavated into the deposit evolve, and (b) what is the time distribution of the material released during the early stages of the process. These goals are achieved by an experimental campaign using a poorly sorted mixture of sediment in the antecedent deposit. The research shows that for the given conditions of our experiments, the rate at which the sediment is released depends on the height of the removed dam, the water discharge and the maximum potential volume of sediment to be eroded. This investigation provides new insights of the width evolution when the sediment is composed of a poorly sorted mixture. This evolution is linked to the bed degradation rates: channel narrows during a rapid incisional phase, and subsequently widens when bed degradation rates decrease. Channel width changes propagate upstream as a convection-like perturbation associated with a kinematic wave starting at the location of the antecedent dam. These features are modeled through a new numerical model accounting for mixtures. More specifically, a set of equations has been derived for the variation of bed elevation, channel bottom width, and bed grain-size distribution, which when solved numerically, describe the observed channel processes.},

  abstract = {Gravel bed rivers commonly exhibit a coarse surface armor resulting from a complex history of interactions between flow and sediment supply. The evolution of the surface texture under single storm events or under steady flow conditions has been studied by a number of researchers. However, the role of successive floods on the surface texture evolution is still poorly understood. An experimental campaign in an 18 m-long 1 m-wide flume has been designed to study these issues. Eight consecutive runs, each one consisting of a low-flow period of variable duration followed by a sudden flood (water pulse) lasting 1.5 h, have been conducted. The total duration of the experiment was 46 h. The initial bed surface was created during a 280 h-long experiment focused on the influence of episodic sediment supply on channel adjustments. Our experiments represent a realistic armored and structured beds found in mountain gravel bed rivers. The armor surface texture persists over the duration of the experiment. The experiment exhibits downstream fining of the bed-surface texture. It was found that sorting processes were affected by the duration of low-flow between flood pulses. Since bed load transport is influenced by sediment sorting, the evolution of bed load transport is impacted by the frequency of the water pulses: short interpulse durations reduce the time over which fine material (transported as bed load) can be winnowed. This, in turn, contributes to declining reduction of the bed load transport over time while the sediment storage increases.},

River profile concavity has been primarily attributed to sediment downstream fining and to streamwise increments of water discharge. Conversely, upward-convex profiles have been typically associated with tectonic and geologic controls and with outlet base-level drops. Equations to describe river profiles at equilibrium developed from mass conservation principles do not consider longitudinal changes in channel width. This study addresses how variations in channel width can also act to control the curvature of longitudinal profiles. We develop a new theoretical framework in which the role on river profiles of downstream variations of channel width, flow discharge, bed roughness, and surface texture are explicitly shown. Unlike classical approaches for river profile evolution, this novel framework identifies physical domains for rivers to develop upward-concave/convex longitudinal profiles depending on channel width and flow discharge gradients flow intensity and surface texture.},

Within a bend the transverse mixing coefficient depends on the square of the mean velocity, cube of the depth, and inversely on the shear velocity and square of the radius of curvature, as verified by a laboratory experiment. The longitudinal dispersion coefficient depends on the channel geometry, velocity distribution, rate of transverse mixing, and a dimensionless parameter that includes the mean velocity and length of an average bend. A numerical program for predicting dispersion coefficients in streams differs from previous theories by including the effect of the alternating direction of curvature in a series of bends; the difference is important for wide streams but not for narrow ones. Experimental findings in two streams, the Green-Duwamish in Washington (width 20 meters), and the Missouri near Omaha, Nebraska (width 180 meters), verify the numerical program.},

  abstract  = {Understanding hydrological processes occurring within a basin by looking at its outlet hydrograph can improve and foster comprehension of ungauged regions. In this context, we present an extensive examination of the roles that floodplains play on driving hydrograph shapes. Observations of many river hydrographs with large floodplain influence are carried out and indicate that a negative skewness of the hydrographs is present among many of them. Through a series of numerical experiments and analytical reasoning, we show how the relationship between flood wave celerity and discharge in such systems is responsible for determining the hydrograph shapes. The more water inundates the floodplains upstream of the observed point, the more negatively skewed is the observed hydrograph. A case study is performed in the Amazon River Basin, where major rivers with large floodplain attenuation (e.g., Purus, Madeira, and Juru!!e!!) are identified with higher negative skewness in the respective hydrographs. Finally, different wetland types could be distinguished by using this feature, e.g., wetlands maintained by endogenous processes, from wetlands governed by overbank flow (along river floodplains). A metric of hydrograph skewness was developed to quantify this effect, based on the time derivative of discharge. Together with the skewness concept, it may be used in other studies concerning the relevance of floodplain attenuation in large, ungauged rivers, where remote sensing data (e.g., satellite altimetry) can be very useful.},

Such a problem, which has been recently tackled by Parker et al. (2003) by means of a theoretical formulation, does not appear to be fully addressed in the literature from an experimental point of view. To this aim, average motion characteristics and transport dynamics of bed particles over an arbitrarily inclined nonerodible bed are studied by means of an experimental activity based on different techniques. A laser Doppler and an image-based technique are developed here and employed to study the average properties of saltating particles, while volumetric sampling is applied to estimate the average bed load transport intensity at equilibrium. Results show the intensity and direction of average particle velocity and average bed load transport as a function of the applied Shields stress for various bed inclinations. It appears that the intensity of bed load transport increases with the applied Shields stress much faster than predicted by the linear formulations on horizontal beds, while its direction may largely deviate from the direction of the applied shear stress at the bed when the bed is transversally tilted. Experimental results are compared with the theoretical results of Parker et al. (2003) and show a good agreement.},

  abstract = {We investigate the morphodynamic evolution of an arbitrarily tilted, coarse, mobile bed under the action of a free surface water flow. The analysis is based on the experimental observations of the evolution of a mobile bed from its initial, laterally tilted configuration to the final laterally flat state, due to the presence of a lateral component of bed load transport. Measurements of the bed topography at different times allow one to reconstruct the flattening process. The experimental observations are interpreted by means of a three-dimensional numerical hydromorphodynamic model employing different relationships, linear and nonlinear, to evaluate bed load intensity and direction. The analysis shows that the inclusion of nonlinear gravitational effects in the description of the bed load leads to a more satisfactory description of the bed evolution. This finding opens important issues on how the inclusion of the nonlinear gravitational effects on the bed load can affect the morphodynamic evolution of complex bed topography occurring in natural rivers. To investigate this point, an application to the evolution of river bars is presented.},

In this paper, an extensive data set from three large bifurcations in the Dutch Rhine is presented, containing data on bed-load transport, suspended bed sediment transport, dune development and hydrodynamics. The data show complex variations in sediment transport during discharge waves. The objective of this paper is to examine and explain these measured variations in sediment transport. It is found that bend sorting upstream of the bifurcations leads to supply limitation, particularly in the downstream branch that originates in the outer bend of the main channel. Tidal water level variations lead to cyclical variations in the sediment distribution over the downstream branches. Lags in dune development cause complex hysteresis patterns in flow parameters and sediment transport. All bifurcations show evidence of sediment waves, which probably are intrinsic bifurcation phenomena. The complex transport processes at the three bifurcations cause distinct discontinuities in the downstream fining trend of the river. Differences among the studied river bifurcations are mainly due to differences in sediment mobility (Shields value). Because the variations in sediment transport are complex and poorly correlated with the flow discharge, prediction of the sediment distribution with existing relationships for one-dimensional models is problematic.},

  abstract  = {A gravel-bed river often changes abruptly into a sand-bed river. The causes of such so-called gravel!!e!!sand transitions have been elucidated in recent years, but detailed observations of gravel!!e!!sand transitions in large rivers are scarce. The present study fills this knowledge gap by investigating the sedimentary characteristics of the gravel!!e!!sand transition in the river Rhine. Data on bed composition and flow characteristics are used, in combination with a novel method for the evaluation of the bed structure. The analysis shows that, in contrast to common belief, the bed structure in the gravel!!e!!sand transition zone does not change from fully clast supported to fully matrix supported. Instead, there is a strong cross-stream variation in bed structure, especially upstream of the transition zone. The analysis also shows that the downstream decrease in gravel mobility in the gravel!!e!!sand transition zone, which is usually attributed to the change in bed structure and the so-called patchiness effect, is at least partly caused by the larger-scale bend sorting process, which concentrates gravel in outer bends where it is only infrequently mobile. Dune sorting, which has been suggested to have an effect on the gravel mobility similar to that of bend sorting, was found to be relatively unimportant in the Rhine, partly because it is strongly counteracted by armoring processes that affect an uncommonly thick sediment layer. The gravel!!e!!sand transition in the Rhine, with its length of 50 km, is much less abrupt than the gravel!!e!!sand transitions of smaller rivers reported on in the literature. Although the dependence of the transition length on river size intuitively is correct, the exact causes remain unclear.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACTRivers are dynamical systems with alternating patterns of sedimentation and erosion. Both sedimentation and erosion may have negative consequences from a perspective of river management. A sediment budget is a most valuable tool for taking measures in river management that deal with sediment dynamics effectively. Drawing-up a sediment budget is time consuming and complicated, but very rewarding in that it strongly increases our understanding of the functional behaviour of a river system and the human impact thereon. The main goal of this article is to provide river managers with arguments in favour of sediment budget studies. This is done by illustrating the benefits of channel sediment budgets for river management using examples from the rivers Scheldt and Rhine. We present 10 reasons for drawing-up sediment budgets for river management: sediment budgets help to: (1) create order in the apparent chaos of data, (2) identify morphological problems, (3) find smart solutions to problems, (4) set research agendas and monitoring strategies, (5) optimize dredging and nourishment strategies, (6) coordinate river management on the basin scale, (7) assess consequences of human interventions, (8) improve numerical models, (9) explain river management to society and (10) train future generations of river managers.},

The analysis is based on E. Jaynes's elaboration of the implications of the similarity between the Gibbs entropy in statistical mechanics and the Shannon entropy in information theory. By maximizing the information entropy of a distribution subject to known constraints on its moments, our choice of the form of the distribution is unbiased. The analysis suggests that particle velocities and travel times are exponentially distributed and that particle accelerations follow a Laplace distribution with zero mean. Particle hop distances, viewed alone, ought to be distributed exponentially. However, the covariance between hop distances and travel times precludes this result. Instead, the covariance structure suggests that hop distances follow a Weibull distribution. These distributions are consistent with high-resolution measurements obtained from high-speed imaging of bed load particle motions. The analysis brings us closer to choosing distributions based on our mechanical insight.},

  abstract = {Abstract The ideas of advection and diffusion of sediment particles are probabilistic constructs that emerge when the Master equation, a precise, probabilistic description of particle conservation, is approximated as a Fokkerâ€“Planck equation. The diffusive term approximates nonlocal transport. It â€˜looksâ€™ upstream and downstream for variations in particle activity and velocities, whose effects modify the advective term. High-resolution measurements of bedload particle motions indicate that the mean squared displacement of tracer particles, when treated as a virtual plume, primarily reflects a nonlinear increase in the variance in hop distances with increasing travel time, manifest as apparent anomalous diffusion. In contrast, an ensemble calculation of the mean squared displacement involving paired coordinate positions independent of starting time indicates a transition from correlated random walks to normal (Fickian) diffusion. This normal behavior also is reflected in the particle velocity autocorrelation function. Spatial variations in particle entrainment produce a flux from sites of high entrainment toward sites of low entrainment. In the case of rain splash transport, this leads to topographic roughening, where differential rain splash beneath the canopy of a desert shrub contributes to the growth of a soil mound beneath the shrub. With uniform entrainment, rain splash transport, often described as a diffusive process, actually represents an advective particle flux that is proportional to the land surface slope. Particle diffusion during both bedload and rain splash transport involves motions that mostly are patchy, intermittent and rarefied. The probabilistic framework of the Master equation reveals that continuous formulations of the flux and its divergence (the Exner equation) represent statistically expected behavior, analogous to Reynolds-averaged conditions. Key topics meriting clarification include the mechanical basis of particle diffusion, effects of rarefied conditions involving patchy, intermittent motions, and effects of rest times on diffusion of tracer particles and particle-borne substances.

  abstract = {Ultrasound measurement of distances in laboratory measurement technology has become increasingly established in recent years. The advantages gained are quite clear: particularly in small-scale experimental set-ups, it is imperative to avoid any mechanical intervention that may affect the experiment, but at the same time, parameters must be measured and evaluated. This not only applies to laboratory operation and water. As the distance to an object is measured by sound propagation time measurement, and not by intensity measurement, as is the case in optical methods, ultrasound sensors have excellent background suppression. Almost all materials that reflect sound are reliably detected, irrespective of their colour. Even transparent materials and thin foils present no problems for our ultrasound sensors. As a result of their high sensitivity, our sensors are also predestined for the detection of liquid surfaces. The sensors measure in dusty air as well as through fine fog. Even thin deposition on the sensor membrane does not impair the sensor function. These characteristics, combined with extremely slender sound cones (with practically no side lobes), make for completely new laboratory applications. The easy-to-use UltraLab� ULS HF5-A laboratory instrument excels as a consequence of the diverse functions implemented, making it suitable for use in complex measurement tasks without having to set a series of parameters. The measurement object can be, for example, the water surface as a level or the moving water surface as a wave. This is where the temporally highly resolved distance measurement comes into its own. A complex measurement algorithm ensures high measurement accuracy and resolution, as well as a high degree of data confidence. The UltraLab� ULS HF5-A is dedicated for sound propagation time measurement of very fast moving waves. This device has four independent channels, each one is equipped with an ultrasound sensor of the type USS13-HF. The data output is realised in analogue voltage signal between 0-10 Volt and digital via serial interface RS 232. Due to high repetition rate of 50 Hz, every measurement unit detects high dynamic processes in an impressive resolution of 0.36 mm. Thanks to the application of a special reference sensor all fluctuations of the sound velocity will be compensated internally. That means, the data obtained from the measurement device are independent of all the sound velocity interfering parameters, e.g. temperature, air humidity, air pressure, etc. Nevertheless the last column of the data telegram contains the sound velocity in m/s. After the switch on of the UltraLab device and a short system test procedure (needs some seconds), the device delivers continuous data. An opto-isolated trigger input makes a synchronisation with external data acquisition possible. The UltraLab� ULS HF5-A is equipped with an serial interface RS232. So it is possible to receive the output data stream at any PC with a help of a terminal program. Please, for configuration of the terminal program on the PC see the respective chapters (chapter 4.2).},

  abstract  = {River bed degradation can proceed downstream as well as upstream depending upon the cause of degradation. The causes of downstream progressing degradation are primarily related to changes in independent river channel variables, such as increase in water discharge, decrease in size of bed material, and decrease in bed material discharge. The causes of upstream progressing degradation are all related to an imposed increase in river slope which can occur as a result of natural river behavior or by man-made changes. Study of various case histories indicates that river slopes are increased by lowering a base level, by decreasing the length of a river, or by removal of a control point. Case histories also show that downstream and upstream progressing degradation can act in combination along a river system: downstream progressing degradation along the main stream of a river system can initiate upstream progressing degradation on a tributary.},

  abstract = {One way to study the mechanism of gravel bed load transport is to seed the bed with marked gravel tracer particles within a chosen patch and to follow the pattern of migration and dispersal of particles from this patch. In this study, we invoke the probabilistic Exner equation for sediment conservation of bed gravel, formulated in terms of the difference between the rate of entrainment of gravel into motion and the rate of deposition from motion. Assuming an active layer formulation, stochasticity in particle motion is introduced by considering the step length (distance traveled by a particle once entrained until it is deposited) as a random variable. For step lengths with a relatively thin (e.g., exponential) tail, the above formulation leads to the standard advectionâ€�diffusion equation for tracer dispersal. However, the complexity of rivers, characterized by a broad distribution of particle sizes and extreme flood events, can give rise to a heavyâ€�tailed distribution of step lengths. This consideration leads to an anomalous advectionâ€�diffusion equation involving fractional derivatives. By identifying the probabilistic Exner equation as a forward Kolmogorov equation for the location of a randomly selected tracer particle, a stochastic model describing the temporal evolution of the relative concentrations is developed. The normal and anomalous advectionâ€�diffusion equations are revealed as its longâ€�time asymptotic solution. Sample numerical results illustrate the large differences that can arise in predicted tracer concentrations under the normal and anomalous diffusion models. They highlight the need for intensive data collection efforts to aid the selection of the appropriate model in real rivers.},

  abstract = {Most of the computational models of curved open channel flows use the conventional depth averaged De St. Venant equations. De St. Venant equations assume uniform velocity and hydrostatic pressure distributions. They are thus applicable only to cases of meandering rivers and curved open channels where vertical details are not of importance. The two-dimensional vertically averaged and moment equations model, developed by the writers, is used to study the effect of applying different distribution shapes for velocities and pressure on the simulation of curved open channels. Linear and quadratic distribution shapes are proposed for the horizontal velocity components, while a quadratic distribution shape is considered for the vertical velocity. Linear hydrostatic and quadratic nonhydrostatic distribution shapes are proposed for the pressure. The proposed model is applied to problems involved in curved open channels with different degrees of curvature. The implicit Petrovâ€“Galerkin finite element scheme is applied in this study. Computed values for depth averaged longitudinal and transverse velocities across the channel width and vertical profiles of longitudinal and transverse velocities are compared to the observed experimental data. A fairly good agreement is attained. Predictions of overall flow characteristics suggest that the results are not very sensitive to different approximations of the preassumed applied velocity and pressure distribution shapes.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a morphodynamic model for free surface flows over bed forms. The model reproduces bed form evolution and migration in a physically based manner. The flow model component of the coupled morphodynamic model, which is two-dimensional in the streamwise and vertical directions, explicitly treats unsteadiness and nonhydrostatic effects. Comparison with measurements shows that the flow model accurately simulates both mean flow and turbulence structure induced by bed forms under free surface flow. The flow model performance is enhanced by the use of a high-order Godunov scheme known as the cubic interpolated pseudoparticle (CIP) technique to compute the advection phase of the Navier-Stokes equation. In addition, an enhanced k-É› turbulence closure with nonlinear terms is incorporated in the present model in order to allow better predictions of Reynolds stress anisotropy in regions with flow separation. Performance of the nonlinear k-É› model is compared with standard k-É› closure in the context of the flow as well as morphodynamic simulation. Nonequilibrium bed load sediment transport is treated using a Eulerian stochastic formulation of the sediment exchange process in terms of pickup and deposition functions. The proposed approach for sediment transport explicitly considers the local flow variability during morphodynamic computation. Model results show that the vertical grid distribution pattern affects the simulation result, particularly for bed form morphodymics. The model successfully simulates some important physical features of bed form evolution, such as amalgamation and asymmetric geometry. The simulation results are in agreement with laboratory experiments as well as some commonly used prediction methods for geometric characteristics of bed forms.},

The textural data presented are unique for a field situation, not only because of the spatial resolution and extent of the sampling program but also because they provide information about the pattern of fining at different points in time. They are supported by equally comprehensive topographic survey data from which local rates of aggradation can be derived. Despite variability induced by lateral sediment inputs, there is an essentially continuous pattern of fining along the entire length of the river. Fining occurs in both the fine and coarse size fractions of the bed material. The highest rates of fining occur in the larger percentiles of the subsurface bed material and in the surface bed material. Downstream fining in the Waipaoa River appears to be a response to changes in flow hydraulics that are regulated by the concave configuration of the long profile. The fining gradient developed rapidly (in <45 years). It does not appear to be influenced by the rate of aggradation (nor the overall rate of sediment supply to the channel system), because, in the short term, aggradation has a negligible impact on the inherited form of the long profile.},

  abstract  = {Along the lower reaches of the Waipaoa River, New Zealand, cross-section survey data indicate there was a 23 per cent decrease in bankfull width and a 22 per cent reduction in channel cross-section area between 1948 and 2000, as the channel responded to increased inputs of fine (suspended) sediment following deforestation of the headwaters in late C19 and early C20. We determined the bankfull discharge within a !!e!!39 km long reach by routing known discharges through the one-dimensional MIKE 11 flow model. The model runs suggest that the bankfull discharge varies between !!e!!800 and !!e!!2300 m3 s!!e!!1 and that the average recurrence interval is 4 !!e!! 2 years on the annual maximum series; by contrast, the effective flow (360 m3 s!!e!!1) is equaled or exceeded three times a year. The variability in bankfull discharge arises because the banks tend to be lower in places where flood flows are constricted than in reaches where overbank flow is dispersed over a wide area, and because scour has counteracted aggradation in some locations. There is no downstream variation in Shields stress, or in relative shear stress, within the study reach. Bankfull shear stress is, on average, five times greater than the shear stress required to initiate motion. At the effective discharge it is more than twice the threshold value. The effective discharge probably has more relevance than the bankfull discharge to the overall picture of sediment movement in the lower reaches of the Waipaoa River but, because width is constrained by the stability and resistance of the bank material to erosion during high flows that also scour the bed, the overall channel geometry is likely determined by discharges at or near bankfull.

  abstract = {Abstract Temporal variations in bedload transport rates that occur at a variety of timescales, even under steady flow conditions, are accepted as an inherent component of the bedload transport process. Rarely, however, has the cause of such variations been explained clearly. We consider three data sets, obtained from laboratory experiments, that refer to measurements of bedload transport made with continuously recording bedload traps. Each data set is characterized by a predominant low-frequency oscillation, on which additional higher-frequency oscillations generally are superimposed. The period of these oscillations, as isolated through the use of spectral analysts, ranged between 0Â·47 and 168 minutes, and was associated unequivocally with the migration of bedforms such as ripples, dunes, and bars. The extent to which such oscillatory behaviour may be recognized in a data set depends on the duration of sampling and the length of the sampling time, with respect to the period of a given bedform. Several theoretical probability distribution functions have been developed to describe the frequency distributions of (relative) bedload transport rates that are associated with the migration of bedforms (Einstein, 1937b; Hamamori, 1962; Carey and Hubbell, 1986). These distribution functions were derived without reference to a sampling interval. We present a modification of Hamamori's (1962) probability distribution function, generated by Monte Carlo simulation, which permits one to specify the sampling interval, in relation to the length of a bedform. Comparisons between the simulated and observed frequency distributions, that were undertaken on the basis of the data described herein, are good (significant at the 90 per cent confidence level). Finally, the implications that temporal variability, which is associated with the migration of bedforms, have for the accurate determination of bedload transport rates are considered.},

Problems involved in using field data to calibrate bedload transport formulae and bedload samplers, and factors that affect the design of sampling programmes are specifically addressed.

  abstract = {A model to predict the roughness in unsteady oscillatory flows over movable, noncohesive beds is presented. The roughness over movable beds is shown to be a function of the boundary shear stress, rather than a fixed geometrical scale as is the case for fully rough turbulent boundary shear flows over immobile beds. The model partitions the roughness into two distinct contributions. These two contributions are due to the form drag around individual bed forms and to the near-bed sediment transport. The form drag over the bed forms is treated explicitly as a function of the boundary geometry and shear stress. The ripples are predicted as a function of the local skin friction, and a semiempirical expression is derived using standard law-of-the-wall arguments, which gives the ripple or form roughness as a function of the boundary geometry. The ripple roughness is found to be proportional to the product of the ripple steepness and height. Favorable comparison of the form drag model with the results of Bagnold's (1946) fixed ripple study is found. The value of z0 associated with intense sediment transport in oscillatory flow over a flat bed is determined from Carstens et al.'s (1969) experiments. This value is found to be 7 or 8 grain diameters. An expression is derived for the roughness associated with the maximum thickness of a near-bottom sediment-transporting layer consistent with Owen's (1964) roughness hypothesis for saltation of uniform grains in air. At large values of the boundary shear stress relative to the critical value for initial sediment motion, the derived expression is similar to the results of Smith and McLean's (1977) unidirectional flow approach modified for oscillatory flow. The total roughness model is found to compare favorably with Carstens et al.'s (1969) data. In contrast to Smith and McLean's (1977) steady flow findings, the results here show that when ripples are present, they account for a significant portion of the boundary roughness.},

Instead of resorting to bed form classification, we propose to evaluate the evolution of multiscale bed topography as the integral of unit contributions defined through a spaceâ€’time Fourier decomposition of bed elevations. Using joint 2â€’D spectra in the frequency and wave number domain, a functional relationship between the length scales and the timescales in which migrating bed forms are decomposed is proposed and developed into a dimensionless expression for scaleâ€’dependent convection velocities. This formulation highlights the violation of Taylor's hypothesis for migrating bed forms, confirming statistically that larger bed forms travel slower as compared to smaller bed forms. This phenomenological description leads to a spectral extension of the Simons et al. (1965) formula for sediment transport to incorporate a range of multiscale migrating features. Both the scaling of convection velocities and the spectral estimate of sediment transport rate were validated through extensive bed elevation data from laboratory experiments conducted at the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory, for a range of Froude numbers 0.2<Fr<0.5, under varying discharge and bed material composition.},

Fixed-vessel ADCP measurements were used to preliminarily investigate the turbulence variability affecting the reliability of moving-vessel measurements. To evaluate the friction velocity by using moving-vessel measurements, the vertical variance of velocity profiles as an alternative to logarithmic fitting of ADCP profiles was estimated. An average of 30-m cells of depth-averaged velocity, friction velocity, and surface-bottom velocity angle are presented in maps as the most relevant flow field features. The flow field and channel morphology at bed-form or channel scales showed noticeable correlations (0.9).

Calibration of the MIKE21C numerical model by the Danish Hydraulic Institute at the 25-km-long reach of Lower ParanÃ  near Rosario (Argentina) is presented. This reach includes two downstream confluences and two bifurcations. The model simulates a 2-D depth-averaged flow velocity and the related sediment fluxes to predict the bifurcation morphodynamics that affects the ParanÃ  waterway. To investigate the river channel bathymetry, roughness, flow discharge allocation at bifurcations, suspended sediment concentration and grain size distributions, several instruments were used. These instruments included two ADCPs by Teledyne RDI working at frequencies of 600 and 1,200 kHz, a Sontek ADCP working at a frequency of 1,000 kHz and a SBES. The method to assess suspended sediment concentration and grain size distributions has been previously described. This paper focuses primarily on investigating dune morphology (by means of SBES depth measurements) and friction velocity (by means of ADCP profiling) to determine the river channel bed-roughness. The 2-D model results agree with observed values of bed-roughness, flow velocity and suspended sediment concentration distributions at the investigated sections, known data of water slope and total load of bed sediment are in good agreement with model results.},

  abstract  = {Abstract A complete understanding of alluvial-bed dynamics is desirable for evaluating a variety of issues related to water resources. Sediment fluxes were investigated in a bifurcation of the large Parana River near Rosario, Argentina. The backscatter estimations from the Doppler profilers provided the suspended load of the sediment forming the riverbed. An echo-sounder was applied to track the dunes yielding the bed-load estimation. Aiming to show the usefulness of the recorded data, a 2-D numerical code was applied to the 10-km long and 2-km wide Rosario reach. The morphodynamic module was un-coupled from the hydrodynamics assessment, which enabled the long-term prediction of the river morphology accounting for the hydrological yearly variation with a quasi-steady approach. Numerical experiments were performed to test the sensitivity of the hydrodynamic model to the computational time-step and mesh size, to test the un-coupling scheme performance regarding the full-dynamic modelling, to test the accuracy of the sediment transport formulae based on the field evidence and, finally, to provide guidance to properly fix the model parameters.},

  abstract = {Numerous research efforts have been devoted to understanding estuarine morphodynamics under tidal forcing. However, the impact of river discharge on estuarine morphodynamics is insufficiently examined. Inspired by the Yangtze Estuary, this work explores the morphodynamic impact of river discharge in a 560 km long tidal basin based on a 1-D model (Delft3D). The model considers total load sediment transport and employs a morphodynamic updating scheme to achieve long-term morphodynamic evolution. We analyze the role of Stokes drift, tidal asymmetry, and river discharge in generating tidal residual sediment transport. Model results suggest that morphodynamic equilibrium is approached within millennia by vanishing spatial gradients of tidal residual sediment transport. We find that the interaction between ebb-directed Stokes return flow/river flow with tides is an important mechanism that flushes river-supplied sediment seaward. Increasing river discharge does not induce continuously eroded or accreted equilibrium bed profiles because of the balance between riverine sediment supply and sediment flushing to the sea. An intermediate threshold river discharge can be defined which leads to a deepest equilibrium bed profile. As a result, the shape (concavity or convexity) of the equilibrium bed profiles will adapt with the magnitude of river discharge. Overall, this study reveals the significant role of river discharge in controlling estuarine morphodynamics by supplying sediment and reinforcing ebb-directed residual sediment transport.},

  abstract = {Rivers supply sediment to estuaries and alter estuarine tidal wave regimes. However, the long-term (>century) impact of seasonally varying river discharges on estuarine morphodynamics is not well understood. Process-based models are useful tools to analyze these morphodynamic processes. This study aims to explore modeling techniques to efficiently include the impact of discharge seasonality on long-term estuarine morphodynamic development by a process-based morphodynamic model. Inspired by the dimensions and hydraulic forcing of the Yangtze River estuary, we evaluate three methodologies to schematize a river discharge hydrograph in a 1-D morphodynamic model. These are a representative constant discharge, a non-compressed hydrograph and a compressed hydrograph. To shorten computational time, the latter methodology decreases the timescale of seasonal river flow variations compared to the tidal timescale. Sensitivity analysis suggests that the yearly averaged sediment transport controls long-term morphodynamic development. Morphodynamic equilibrium is reached after millennia when deposition during a high river flow period is balanced by erosion during a low river flow period. An important finding is that a yearly hydrograph can be squeezed in time up to a factor of 20, without leading to unrealistic river!!e!!tide interactions. Applying a constant river discharge may not produce equilibrium bed profiles that are similar to that under hydrograph forcing due to the non-linearity in sediment transport. The long characteristic timescales in defining morphodynamic equilibrium indicate that a long-term view is needed to interpret large scale estuarine morphodynamics. Though simple and highly schematized, the modeling experiments in this study provide conceptual understanding of morphodynamics in river-influenced estuaries.},

  abstract = {Tidal basin and delta morphodynamics have been broadly examined by numerical modeling efforts, but large scale estuarine morphodynamics under combined river and tidal forcing have been less examined. This study aims to explore morphodynamic development of a river- and tide-forced fluvio-deltaic system using a 2DH process-based numerical model (Delft3D). The model domain describes a 560km long, convergent inner basin attached to a >50km wide outer sea basin allowing for delta formation. Long-term (millennial) morphodynamic simulation is aided by a morphological factor approach which captures the feedback mechanisms between water motion, sediment movement, and morphology. The morphodynamic sensitivities to river discharge magnitude and its seasonal variations are systematically examined. Model results show that a fluvio-deltaic system develops with meandering channels and alternating sand bars in the estuarine part, and distributary channels with elongated sand bars in the delta. Sensitivity analysis shows that river discharge plays a profound role in the morphodynamic behavior by supplying sediment and enhancing ebb-directed residual transport. An intermediate river discharge can be defined which leads to a deeper estuarine basin. A river discharge smaller than the intermediate threshold limits ebb flow magnitude and erosive capacity. A river discharge larger than the threshold supplies much more sediment to the estuary so that the basin becomes shallower with larger meanders, more pronounced ebb tidal channels, and a larger delta. Based on our simulations we can differentiate tide-dominance from river-dominance in estuary classifications by ebb to flood ratios of flow and sediment fluxes. Overall, this modeling study extends understanding of morphodynamics of a comprehensive fluvio-deltaic system, thus allowing for a better management of estuaries and deltas.},

So far, it is known that a number of tidal interactions (e.g., M2-M4 and M2-O1-K1) can induce tidal asymmetry and associated TRST; however, their variability and morphodynamic impacts are insufficiently explored. Inspired by the river and tidal forcing conditions in the Yangtze River Estuary, we explore the morphodynamic development of a 560!!e!!km long estuary under the boundary forcing conditions of varyingly combined tidal constituents and river discharges using a schematized 1-D morphodynamic model for long-term (millennial) simulations. We then employ an analytical scheme which integrates sediment transport as a function of flow velocities to decompose the contribution of different tidal interactions on TRST and to explain how the river and tidal interactions control TRST and associated morphodynamics. Model results display varying equilibrium bed profiles. Analytical results suggest that (1) a series of tidal interactions creates multiple tidal asymmetries and associated TRST, (2) river flow modulates tidal asymmetry nonlinearly in space, and (3) more tidal constituents at the sea boundary persistently enhance the seaward TRST through river-tide interactions. It is the combined effects of multiple tidal asymmetries and river-tide interactions that determine the net TRST and consequent morphodynamic development. It thus suggests that tidal harmonics of significant amplitudes need to be considered properly as boundary conditions for long-term, large-scale morphodynamic modeling.},

  abstract = {There is no standard nomenclature and procedure to systematically identify the scale and magnitude of bed forms such as bars, dunes, and ripples that are commonly present in many sedimentary environments. This paper proposes a standardization of the nomenclature and symbolic representation of bed forms and details the combined application of robust spline filters and continuous wavelet transforms to discriminate these morphodynamic features, allowing the quantitative recognition of bed form hierarchies. Herein the proposed methodology for bed form discrimination is first applied to synthetic bed form profiles, which are sampled at a Nyquist ratio interval of 2.5!!e!!50 and a signal-to-noise ratio interval of 1!!e!!20 and subsequently applied to a detailed 3-D bed topography from the R!!e!!o Paran!!e!!, Argentina, which exhibits large-scale dunes with superimposed, smaller bed forms. After discriminating the synthetic bed form signals into three-bed form hierarchies that represent bars, dunes, and ripples, the accuracy of the methodology is quantified by estimating the reproducibility, the cross correlation, and the standard deviation ratio of the actual and retrieved signals. For the case of the field measurements, the proposed method is used to discriminate small and large dunes and subsequently obtain and statistically analyze the common morphological descriptors such as wavelength, slope, and amplitude of both stoss and lee sides of these different size bed forms. Analysis of the synthetic signals demonstrates that the Morlet wavelet function is the most efficient in retrieving smaller periodicities such as ripples and smaller dunes and that the proposed methodology effectively discriminates waves of different periods for Nyquist ratios higher than 25 and signal-to-noise ratios higher than 5. The analysis of bed forms in the R!!e!!o Paran!!e!! reveals that, in most cases, a Gamma probability distribution, with a positive skewness, best describes the dimensionless wavelength and amplitude for both the lee and stoss sides of large dunes. For the case of smaller superimposed dunes, the dimensionless wavelength shows a discrete behavior that is governed by the sampling frequency of the data, and the dimensionless amplitude better fits the Gamma probability distribution, again with a positive skewness. This paper thus provides a robust methodology for systematically identifying the scales and magnitudes of bed forms in a range of environments.},

  abstract = {Abstract Hans A. Einstein initiated a probabilistic approach to modelling sediment transport in rivers. His formulae were based on theory and were stimulated by laboratory investigations. The theory assumes that bed load movement occurs in individual steps of rolling, sliding or saltation and rest periods. So far very few attempts have been made to measure stochastic elements in nature. For the first time this paper presents results of radio-tracing the travel path of individual particles in a large braided gravel bed river: the Waimakariri River of New Zealand. As proposed by Einstein, it was found that rest periods can be modelled by an exponential distribution, but particle step lengths are better represented by a gamma distribution. Einstein assumed an average travel distance of 100 grain-diameters for any bed load particle between consecutive points of deposition, but larger values of 6Â·7 m or 150 grain-diameters and 6Â·1 m or 120 grain-diameters were measured for two test particle sizes. Together with other available large scale field data, a dependence of the mean step length on particle diameter relative to the D50 of the bed surface was found. During small floods the time used for movement represents only 2Â·7\% of the total time from erosion to deposition. The increase in percentage of time being used for transport means that it then has to be regarded in stochastic transport models. Tracing the flow path of bed load particles between erosion and deposition sites is a step towards explaining the interactions between sediment transport and river morphology.

  abstract = {Bifurcations are key geomorphological nodes in anabranching and braided fluvial channels, controlling local bed morphology, the routing of sediment and water, and ultimately defining the stability of their associated diffluence!!e!!confluence unit. Recently, numerical modelling of bifurcations has focused on the relationship between flow conditions and the partitioning of sediment between the bifurcate channels. Herein, we report on field observations spanning September 2013 to July 2014 of the three-dimensional flow structure, bed morphological change and partitioning of both flow discharge and suspended sediment through a large diffluence!!e!!confluence unit on the Mekong River, Cambodia, across a range of flow stages (from 13 500 to 27 000!!e!!m3!!e!!s!!e!!1).Analysis of discharge and sediment load throughout the diffluence!!e!!confluence unit reveals that during the highest flows (Q!!e!!=!!e!!27 000!!e!!m3!!e!!s!!e!!1), the downstream island complex is a net sink of sediment (losing 2600!!e!!2000!!e!!kg s!!e!!1 between the diffluence and confluence), whereas during the rising limb (Q!!e!!=!!e!!19 500!!e!!m3!!e!!s!!e!!1) and falling limb flows (Q!!e!!=!!e!!13 500!!e!!m3!!e!!s!!e!!1) the sediment balance is in quasi-equilibrium. We show that the discharge asymmetry of the bifurcation varies with discharge and highlight that the influence of upstream curvature-induced water surface slope and bed morphological change may be first-order controls on bifurcation configuration. Comparison of our field data to existing bifurcation stability diagrams reveals that during lower (rising and falling limb) flow the bifurcation may be classified as unstable, yet transitions to a stable condition at high flows. However, over the long term (1959!!e!!2013) aerial imagery reveals the diffluence!!e!!confluence unit to be fairly stable. We propose, therefore, that the long-term stability of the bifurcation, as well as the larger channel planform and morphology of the diffluence!!e!!confluence unit, may be controlled by the dominant sediment transport regime of the system. !!e!! 2017 The Authors.

  abstract = {The flow of a river that transports sediment in the form of gravel as bedload is investigated for the case when the transport is small. The linear stability of such flows is discussed and used to formulate some strongly nonlinear investigations describing the interaction of bar instabilities that are known to occur. The key spatial scales in the asymptotic limit of small transport are identified, and highly nonlinear evolution equations derived for each case. A generalized KDV equation is found to govern the nonlinear evolution at small wavenumbers, while at O(1) wavenumbers an infinite set of â€œtriadâ€�likeâ€� amplitude equations describes the flow. The interactions demonstrate the natural tendency of rivers of width significantly higher than the critical width at which instability first occurs to form complex patterns that may be associated with braided rivers. The weak transport limit used in our anaysis makes our work directly relevant to rivers experiencing flood conditions where the onset of a flood causes transport to begin. The results shown suggest that in the highly nonlinear stages, bars take the form of slabs tilted in the flow direction with steep edges. In addition, it is found that there is no equilibrium state. These findings are consistent with observations.},

  abstract  = {We investigate large-scale morphologic changes over a 65-year period in a major sedimentation zone within the 50-km long wandering gravel-bed reach of lower Fraser River, British Columbia. This reach remains in a relatively pristine state compared with many major rivers in populated regions even though various forms of human interference have occurred over the past century to mitigate flooding and erosion concerns. A template of channel evolutionary development is identified, consisting of extended periods of orderly accretion of unit bars by deposition of gravel sheets, controlled by the major riffles in the river. When this process constricts channel conveyance an avulsion occurs and the major bar complexes are reorganized. The recognition of fairly predictable short-term behavior can potentially aid the development of models of sediment transport and channel evolution. Accordingly, results of the detailed descriptive analysis are compared with a GIS-based probabilistic approach developed from transition-state analysis. This reveals that the river has a far stronger tendency to retain its existing morphology than to change its form within a roughly decennial time scale !!e!! regardless of the magnitude of intervening flows !!e!! but that this tendency gradually declines over time as major bar and island complexes are re-worked by sediment exchange. The timescale for major bar development appears to be of the order 30!!e!!years, while complete sediment exchange occurs within a century. Copyright !!e!! 2012 John Wiley  \&  Sons, Ltd.},

The pressure distribution along the bedform is obtained by analyzing the incompressible, rotational inviscid flow over a theoretical ripple profile with the help of the Finite Element Method.

  abstract  = {River bifurcations are key nodes within braided river systems controlling the flow and sediment partitioning and therefore the dynamics of the river braiding process. Recent research has shown that certain geometrical configurations induce instabilities that lead to downstream mid-channel bar formation and the formation of bifurcations. However, we currently have a poor understanding of the flow division process within bifurcations and the flow dynamics in the downstream bifurcates, both of which are needed to understand bifurcation stability. This paper presents results of a numerical sensitivity experiment undertaken using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with the purpose of understanding the flow dynamics of a series of idealized bifurcations. A geometric sensitivity analysis is undertaken for a range of channel slopes (0.005 to 0.03), bifurcation angles (22!!e!! to 42!!e!!) and a restricted set of inflow conditions based upon simulating flow through meander bends with different curvature on the flow field dynamics through the bifurcation. The results demonstrate that the overall slope of the bifurcation affects the velocity of flow through the bifurcation and when slope asymmetry is introduced, the flow structures in the bifurcation are modified. In terms of bifurcation evolution the most important observation appears to be that once slope asymmetry is greater than 0.2 the flow within the steep bifurcate shows potential instability and the potential for alternate channel bar formation. Bifurcation angle also defines the flow structures within the bifurcation with an increase in bifurcation angle increasing the flow velocity down both bifurcates. However, redistributive effects of secondary circulation caused by upstream curvature can very easily counter the effects of local bifurcation characteristics.

In addition, the momentum transport between fields is implicit, allowing for all degrees of coupling, from very loose to completely tied together. Phase transitions permit interchange of mass, momentum and energy between fields, each of which is composed of several components. Considerable generality is present, to permit application to a wide scope of complicated problems, for example, the fluidized dust bed, the flow of a liquid with entrained bubbles, and atmospheric condensation with the fall of precipitation.},

As flow increases, areas of partial transport grow at the expense of inactive areas and fully active areas replace areas with partial mobility. Approximately 25â€“50\% of the bed remained in a state of partial mobility during a flood with a 2â€�year return period, indicating that inactive regions of the bed surface typically persist from year to year. During a flood with a 7â€�year return period, surface grain entrainment was nearly complete, indicating that full mobilization of surface grains is not a frequent event.},

Magnetically tagged gravels deployed in Carnation Creek have been monitored repeatedly over 17years. Four metrics used to describe the extent of dispersion document that the overall shape in the spatial distribution of grain location changes over time. The general trends mask the complexity of the dispersion process, expressed by channel sections where tracers are concentrated regardless of grain size. The distribution of total grain displacement responsible for dispersion evolves as tracers become well mixed. Results demonstrate that observations from the field are crucial to the understanding and modeling of sediment dispersion because they provide key insights into the dispersion process that must be known a priori for mathematical modeling and similar observations cannot be collected using laboratory flumes.},

The theory also leads to the definition of a coefficient of bank erosion of a general nature. Based on data for channel shift for several Japanese rivers, it could be concluded that the universal erosion coefficient decreases as the index (number of blows) of the standard penetration test, as applied to the river bank, increases.

Results of 64 gravel-bed field tracer experiments covering a wide range of flow and sediment supply regimes are compiled here to determine the probabilistic character of gravel transport. We focus on whether particle travel distances and waits are thin- or heavy-tailed. While heavy-tailed travel distance distributions are observed between successive monitoring events in different hydrological and sediment supply regimes, heavy-tailedness does not persist through total travel distance over multiple monitoring events, suggesting that individual monitoring events occur before particle travel distance exceeds the characteristic correlation length for the channel (such that particles that start in fast paths remain in fast paths and particles in slow paths remain in slow paths). After a large number of transport events, super-diffusive spreading was not observed at any of the gravel bed streams. Continuous-time tracking of x, y, z coordinates of tracers in natural streams is necessary to capture exact step and waiting time distributions.},

The compound Poisson model of Einstein-Hubbell-Sayre and a simple gamma function model were compared with observed distributions of moved particles, and of all particles. Both models fit the data reasonably well for small mean displacements, but notable misfits occurred in an event with large mean displacement. When mean particle travel distance approaches the scale of bar spacing, trapping in the bars interrupts particle progress and the dispersion process. The data remain very noisy, so definitive discrimination of suitable models will require trials with more than 103 particles.},

  abstract = {Burial of transported material in gravel bed rivers was examined using several hundred magnetically tagged particles. Burial depth of individual particles varies with no simple relation to particle size. Distributions of burial depth of particles were examined by considering observed burial depth of individual size groups of all mobile particles and of all tagged particles (including static ones). â€œSimpleâ€� (singleâ€�peak) flow events yielded exponential distributions of burial depth of mobile particles. Distributions with secondary peaks were obtained from large and multipeak events. Season long results were skew peaked with a tendency toward uniformity. An mâ€�layer model is developed to account for the variation of frequency of burial depth of particles, based on the assumptions that the burial depth of particles in a simple event is exponentially distributed and the proportion of particles which change vertical position from a given layer is constant from event to event. The model is elaborated for varying mixing rates, varying scour depths, and variable behavior of different size classes. After many events the material is uniformly distributed throughout all layers, in conformity with field experience.},

  abstract = {Abstract The channel dynamics of an ephemeral sandbed river, the Metsemotlhaba in southeast Botswana, were studied over a five year period using tagged magnetic particles of pebble and cobble size, scour chains and topographic cross-sections, with particular emphasis on the three-dimensional dispersal of gravels, patterns of scour and fill and depth of active layer. Two major flow events of equivalent magnitude occurred, moving the tagged particles, in December 1987, a mean distance of 837â€…m at a mean burial depth of 0Â·40â€…m, and in March 1991, a mean distance of 263â€…m at a mean burial depth of 0Â·39â€…m. The volume of mobile sediment, based on scour depth and distance of travel, was 2Â·7 times greater in the December 1987 event, in which the mean scour depth was almost twice the mean burial depth of the tagged particles. The distribution of distance of movement was asymmetrical in this first flood, when the tracer started from a surface location, but was monotonic thereafter. Intervening small to medium events yielded limited tracer movement with a mean burial depth equivalent to depth of scour. The tracer moved in the low and transitional flow regimes. Burial depth distribution followed the gamma model. Field data confirm that longitudinal transport is independent of particle size and shape, and strongly skewed with respect to distance, whilst depths of scour in excess of 1â€…m for high magnitude events suggest that scour values predicted from the empirical equation of Leopold et al. underestimate by an order of magnitude.

Scaling theories and numerical simulations are important tools to describe diffusion processes (random walks: the â€˜ant in the labyrinthâ€™) on percolation systems and fractals. Different types of disordered systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion are presented (the incipient infinite percolation cluster, diffusion-limited aggregation clusters, lattice animals, and random combs), and scaling theories as well as numerical simulations of greater sophistication are described.

  abstract = {Abstract Increased knowledge of clusters is essential for the understanding of sediment transport behavior and the monitoring and protection of aquatic life. A physical study using graded river gravels is conducted in a laboratory environment. Using photogrammetry and painted gravels, a cluster identification tool (CIT) is developed based on image subtraction between subsequent frames, allowing identification of any stable areas and groups of particles on the bed. This is combined with digital particle tracking (DPT) to present a novel approach for monitoring the formation and disintegration of clusters. Clusters from graded gravels are formed successfully during the experimental stage, allowing investigation into the complex dynamic behavior of cluster formation and disintegration in a simulated natural environment. Various anchor stone arrangements are used in the experiments. However, only about one fifth of the potential anchor stones on the bed surface enable cluster formation. In general, clusters classified as â€œtypicalâ€� and â€œheapâ€� are most common. Inspection of temporal cluster coverage of the test-bed surface shows that the proportion of clusters present on the surface tends to grow with time. Maximum cluster surface coverage of between 5\% and 34\% is observed. In addition, particles entering and departing from clusters are monitored. Most commonly, particles enter from directly upstream of the cluster, however >20\% of particles approach from a direction >20 deg from the streamwise direction. Approximately 35\% of all particles directly upstream of a cluster bypass the cluster.},

Four approaches are addressed to obtain modelâ€“prototype similarity, to quantify scale effects and to define limiting criteria under which they can be neglected. These are inspectional analysis, dimensional analysis, calibration and scale series, which are applied to landslide generated impulse waves. Tables include both limiting criteria to avoid significant scale effects and typical scales of physical hydraulic engineering models for a wide variety of hydraulic flow phenomena. The article further shows why it is challenging to model sediment transport and distensible structures in a physical hydraulic model without significant scale effects.

  abstract  = {Fine sediment infiltration into a river bed is a physical process affected by different human actions and has several environmental, socioeconomic, and river morphology consequences. A theoretical model is proposed herein aiming to reproduce the fine sediment content depth profile resulting from the infiltration of fine sediment into an initially clean gravel bed. The model is based on the probability of infiltrating particles to be trapped in a pore throat formed by three bed particles. The model is tested against previous experimental results and is found to reproduce adequately the occurrence of the two infiltration mechanisms reported by previous studies: bridging and unimpeded static percolation. Theoretical depth profiles are found to underestimate fine sediment content at the bed subsurface (below 2!!e!!3 gravel diameter depth) compared to the laboratory results. This may be due to hyporheic flow that is not taken into account in our model. In flow experiments, the particles previously infiltrated and deposited might be destabilized by pore water flow and their fall down to the bed might be magnified.},

We focus particularly on the fluctuations of particle activity, which is defined as the number of moving particles per unit bed length. Based on a stochastic model recently proposed by Ancey and Heyman (2014), we derive the second moment of particle activity analytically, that is, the spatial correlation functions of particle activity. From these expressions, we show that large moving particle clusters can develop spatially. Also, we provide evidence that fluctuations of particle activity are scale dependent. Two characteristic lengths emerge from the model: a saturation length â„“sat describing the length needed for a perturbation in particle activity to relax to the homogeneous solution and a correlation length â„“c describing the typical size of moving particle clusters. A dimensionless PÃ©clet number can also be defined according to the transport model. Three different experimental data sets are used to test the theoretical results. We show that the stochastic model describes spatial patterns of particle activity well at all scales. In particular, we show that â„“c and â„“sat may be relatively large compared to typical scales encountered in bed load experiments (grain diameter, water depth, bed form wavelength, flume length, etc.) suggesting that the spatial fluctuations of particle activity have a nonnegligible impact on the average transport process.},

  abstract = {In gravel bed rivers, bed load transport exhibits considerable variability in time and space. Recently, stochastic bed load transport theories have been developed to address the mechanisms and effects of bed load transport fluctuations. Stochastic models involve parameters such as particle diffusivity, entrainment, and deposition rates. The lack of hard information on how these parameters vary with flow conditions is a clear impediment to their application to real-world scenarios. In this paper, we determined the closure equations for the above parameters from laboratory experiments. We focused on shallow supercritical flow on a sloping mobile bed in straight channels, a setting that was representative of flow conditions in mountain rivers. Experiments were run at low sediment transport rates under steady nonuniform flow conditions (i.e., the water discharge was kept constant, but bed forms developed and migrated upstream, making flow nonuniform). Using image processing, we reconstructed particle paths to deduce the particle velocity and its probability distribution, particle diffusivity, and rates of deposition and entrainment. We found that on average, particle acceleration, velocity, and deposition rate were responsive to local flow conditions, whereas entrainment rate depended strongly on local bed activity. Particle diffusivity varied linearly with the depth-averaged flow velocity. The empirical probability distribution of particle velocity was well approximated by a Gaussian distribution when all particle positions were considered together. In contrast, the particles located in close vicinity to the bed had exponentially distributed velocities. Our experimental results provide closure equations for stochastic or deterministic bed load transport models.},

In this paper, we investigate the plausibility of heavyâ€�tailed movements for particles in bed load transport using carefully controlled flume experiments and theoretical analysis. In our experimental setting, we find travel distances for particles of a given size follow an exponential distribution whose mean varies with grain size. Building on previous work of Stark et al.

Heavyâ€�tailed travel distance can lead to anomalous diffusion in bed load transport, modeled by fractional derivatives in the transport equation.},

  abstract = {When fine sediment is added to a coarse-grained system, the mobility and composition of the bed can change dramatically. We conducted a series of flume experiments to determine how the size of fine particles introduced to an active gravel bed influences the mobility and composition of the bed. We initiated our experiments using a constant water discharge and feed rate of gravel. After the system reached steady state, we doubled the feed rate by supplying a second sediment of equal or lesser size, creating size ratios from 1:1 to 1:150. As we decreased the relative size of the fine particles, the system transitioned among three regimes: (1) For particle size ratios close to one, the bed slope increased to transport the additional load of similar-sized particles. The bed surface remained planar and unchanged. (2) For intermediate particle size ratios, the bed slope decreased with the additional fines. The bed surface became patchy with regions of fine and coarse grains. (3) For the largest particle size ratios (the smallest fines), the bed slope remained relatively unchanged. The subsurface became clogged with fine sediment, but fine particles were not present in the surface layer. This third regime constitutes washload, defined by those fractions that do not affect bed-material transport conditions. Our results indicate washload should be defined in terms of three conditions: small grain size relative to that of the bed material, full suspension based on the Rouse number, and a small rate of fine sediment supply relative to transport capacity.},

  abstract = {Temporal variability in bedload transport rates and spatial variability in sediment storage have been reported with increasing frequency in recent years. A spatial and temporal classification for these features is suggested based on the gravel bedform classification of Church and Jones (1982). The identified scales, meso-, macro-, and mega- are each broad, and within each there is a wide range of processes acting to produce bedload fluctuations. Sampling the same data set with different sampling intervals yields a near linear relationship between sampling interval and pulse period. A range of modelling strategies has been applied to bed waves. The most successful have been those which allow for the three-dimensional nature of sediment storage processes, and which allow changes in the width and depth of stored sediment. The existence of bed waves makes equilibrium in gravel-bed rivers necessarily dynamic. Bedload pulses and bed waves can be regarded as equilibrium forms at sufficiently long timescales.},

We show that these schemes converge strongly in <tex-math>$L^1_{\operatorname{loc}}$</tex-math> norm to the solution of an inhomogeneous conservation law containing a Borel measure source term. Moreover, we analyze the properties of this Borel measure, and derive a sharp estimate for the L<sup>1</sup> error between the limit function given by the scheme and the correct solution. In general, the measure source term is of the order of the entropy dissipation measure associated with the scheme. In certain cases, the error can be small for short times, which makes it difficult to detect numerically. But generically, such an error will grow in time, and this would lead to a large error for large-time calculations. Finally, we show that a local correction of any high-order accurate scheme in nonconservative form is sufficient to ensure its convergence to the correct solution.},

  abstract = {Despite several decades of investigations, accounting for the effect of the wide range of grain sizes composing the bed of rivers on bedload transport remains a challenging problem. We investigate this problem by studying experimentally the influence of grain size distribution on bedload transport in the simple configuration of a bimodal sediment bed composed of a mixture of 2 populations of quartz grains of sizes D1Â =Â 0.7Â Â±Â 0.1Â mm and D2Â =Â 2.2Â Â±Â 0.4Â mm, respectively. The experiments are carried out in a tilted rectangular flume inside which the sediment bed is sheared by a steady and spatially uniform turbulent flow. Using a high-speed video imaging system, we focus on the measurement of the average particle velocity and the surface density of moving particles, defined as the number of moving particles per unit surface of the bed. These two quantities are measured separately for each population of grains as a function of the dimensionless shear stress (or Shields number) and the fraction of the bed surface covered with small grains. We show that the average velocity and the surface density of moving particles obey the same equations as those reported by Lajeunesse et al. (2010) for a bed of homogeneous grain size. Once in motion, the grains follow therefore similar laws whether the bed is made of uniform sediment or of a bimodal mixture. This suggests that the erosion-deposition model established by Lajeunesse et al. (2010) for a bed of uniform sediment can be generalized to the case of a bimodal one. The only difference evidenced by our experiments concerns the critical Shields number for incipient sediment motion. Above a uniform sediment bed, the latter depends on the particle Reynolds number through the Shields curve. In the case of a bimodal bed, our experiments show that the critical Shields numbers of both populations of grains decrease linearly with the fraction of the bed surface covered with small grains. We propose a simple model to account for this observation.},

For almost a century, this onset has been treated as a discontinuous transition at which hydrodynamic forces overcome gravity-loaded grain!!e!!grain friction. Using a custom laminar-shear flume to image slow granular dynamics deep into the bed, here we find that the onset is instead a continuous transition from creeping to granular flow. This transition occurs inside the dense granular bed at a critical viscous number, similar to granular flows and colloidal suspensions and inconsistent with hydrodynamic frameworks. We propose a new phase diagram for sediment transport, where !!e!!bed load!!e!! is a dense granular flow bounded by creep below and suspension above. Creep is characteristic of disordered solids and reminiscent of soil diffusion on hillslopes. Results provide new predictions for the onset and dynamics of sediment transport that challenge existing models.},

  abstract = {The underlying assumption of a lumped element model is that a spatially distributed physical system can be approximated by a topology of discrete entities. The impact of this assumption is illustrated by a model of a finitely long elastic rod with uniform cross section. The model involves a cascade of masses and springs, where the boundary itself is driven by a step function. Previous authors have found closed-form solutions to related problems using the Laplace transform, while in this article we obtain closed-form solutions by eigenvalue decomposition. This means that the extension to a rod with non-uniform cross section is further illuminated. The closed-form solution is compared to a closed-form solution of a distributed parameter model. Both solutions involve a sum of a forward and a backward moving wave that travels with the speed of sound. In the case of the distributed parameter model, these waves are perfect square waves, while in the case of the lumped element model, these waves are imperfect square waves that are subjected to â€œGibbs-likeâ€� ringing. Properties of this phenomenon are described. It is also shown that this phenomenon disappears, when using a continuous step function and a model with sufficiently many elements.},

  abstract  = {Equilibrium is defined as a single-valued, temporally invariant functional relationship between the values of an output variable and the values of the input variable(s) in a geomorphic system. Disequilibrium occurs if the output deviates from the functional relationship by more than a consensual degree. Natural geomorphic variables are characterized by a relaxation time. Output variables are insensitive to cyclical inputs with frequencies much greater than the relaxation time, but can respond completely for sufficiently low frequencies. Rapid trends, recent step changes or pulse inputs, and intermediate frequency inputs can cause disequilibrium.The gradient of sand-bed alluvial channels (the output variable) is determined by sediment and water delivery from slopes (the input variables), and changes in this hydraulic regime require regrading by erosion and deposition. Initial stages of adjustment to changed regime in a long, unbranched channel with sediment and water delivery only at the upstream end propagate downstream, but later stages of adjustment occur simultaneously throughout the reach. In a dendritic channel network the gradient responds rather uniformly throughout the network to changes in regime during all stages of adjustment. The time scale of adjustment to changed regime depends upon the size of the channel network (or stream length), the sediment and water discharges, and to a lesser degree upon the magnitude of the change.Grade as defined by Mackin (1948) is synonymous with equilibrium as used in this paper if �a period of years� is replaced by �a time period commensurate with the relaxation time of the gradient�. The use of the term grade is best restricted to a single-valued relationship between channel gradient and the hydraulic regime.},

  abstract = {A numerical experiment is carried out to study the suitability of two-dimensional (2D) depth-averaged modeling for bend-flow simulation, in which the geometry of the studied channel is rectangular. Two commonly used 2D depth-averaged models for bend-flow simulation are considered in this study of which the bend-flow model includes the dispersion stress terms by incorporating the assumption of secondary-current velocity profile, and the conventional model neglects the dispersion stress terms. The maximum relative discrepancy of the longitudinal velocity, obtained from the comparison of these two models, is used as a criterion to judge their applicability for bend-flow simulation. The analysis of simulation results indicated that the maximum relative difference in longitudinal velocity is mainly related to the relative strength of the secondary current and the relative length of the channel. Empirical relations between the maximum relative difference in the longitudinal velocity, the relative strength of the secondary current, and the relative length of the channel for both the channel-bend region and the straight region following the bend have been established. The proposed relations provide a guideline for model users to determine the proper approach to simulate the bend-flow problem by either using the conventional model or the bend-flow model. Experimental data have been adopted herein to demonstrate the applicability and to verify the accuracy of the proposed relations.},

Two hypothetical cases are adopted. The results show that the secondary-current effect caused by flow is very limited and is reflected mainly from the circulatory transport term which is contained in the contaminant transport equation. A numerical experiment is carried out to judge the effect level of the secondary current. The results indicated that the maximum relative difference in concentration, MaxC* , obtained from the comparison of models with and without considering the secondary-current effect is mainly related to the relative strength of the secondary current SI and the relative length of the bend Î¸b,. Empirical relations including the classification on effect level of secondary current and the MaxC*-SI-Î¸ b relation have been tentatively established. The former relation can serve as a guideline for model users to judge how important the secondary-current effect is and when the effect should be included in the model. The later relation can be regarded as an auxiliary relationship for the former to quantify the deviation between models with and without considering the secondary-current effect.

Based on statistical analysis and considering the transport mechanisms, the rules of sediment concentration distribution near a channel bed are studied. Analytical expressions for the near-bed sediment concentration distribution and mean sediment concentration are derived, and the expression for the mean sediment concentration near the bed is verified by measured data, which were obtained from previous experiments. With the help of statistical theory, the expressions of basic probabilities, i.e., rolling, saltating, and suspending probabilities, for sediment movement near the bed are also derived. The expression for starting probability is verified by the measured data. The verification shows that the results from the proposed expression agree well with the measured data.

  abstract  = {Abstract For several decades, quantification of riverbed grain size stratigraphic evolution has been based upon the active layer formulation (ALF), which unfortunately involves considerable uncertainty. While it is the sediment exchange across the bed surface that directly affects the riverbed stratigraphy, it has been assumed in the \{ALF\} that the sediment fraction at the lower interface of the active layer is a linear function of the sediment fraction in the flow. Here it is proposed that the sediment fraction of the sediment exchange flux is used directly in estimating the sediment fraction at the lower surface of the active layer. Together with the size-specific mass conservation for riverbed sediment, the modified approach is referred to as the surface-based formulation (SBF). When incorporated into a coupled non-capacity modelling framework for fluvial processes, the \{SBF\} leads to results that agree as well or better than those using \{ALF\} with laboratory and field observations. This is illustrated for typical cases featuring bed aggradation and degradation due to graded bed-load sediment transport. Systematic experiments on graded sediment transport by unsteady flows are warranted for further testing the modified formulation.},

  abstract = {In the hydraulics industry, an accurate numerical approximation of the equations  governing sediment transport in coastal regions has recently become a major topic of  interest. These equations comprise the shallow water equations governing the water  flow with the addition of a bed transport equation. It is common practice in industry  to simplify the equations governing sediment transport by assuming the water flow  is in an equilibrium state and the bed has a negligible effect on the water flow.  However, this approach is limited as only steady flow and a slow moving bed can be  approximated accurately in this manner. Thus, an unsteady approach is required  that is considerably more robust and approximates the full system simultaneously.  Until recently, the classic Lax-Wendroff scheme has been widely used in industry  to obtain a numerical solution to the equations, but not surprisingly the numerical  results obtained suffered from spurious oscillations resulting in the numerical scheme  becoming unstable for long time periods. In industry, different measures have been  applied to the use of classic Lax-Wendroff scheme to try to eliminate the spurious  oscillations such as flux-limiter methods and using a small Courant number.  Unfortunately, the spurious oscillations could not be eliminated and overpowered  the numerical results for long computational run times. In this thesis, a variety  of numerical schemes are discussed including adapted versions of the Lax-Friedrichs  scheme, classic Lax-Wendroff scheme, MacCormack scheme and Roe�s scheme. High  resolution schemes are also derived that satisfy the TVD property so that no spurious  oscillations will occur in the numerical results. Five different formulations are then  derived, which are based on either a steady or unsteady approach, and are used  with the most accurate scheme and compared with the classic Lax-Wendroff scheme  to obtain a numerical approximation of the equations. The numerical results are  compared to determine which approach and numerical scheme is the most accurate.  Sediment transport in both one and two dimensions is considered and dimensional  splitting schemes are also discussed in two dimensions.},

Channel sediment analyses considered the petrography, granulometry, and morphometry of the pebbles, relating these to the river bed and floodplain geometry and to some properties of the drainage basin.The following conclusions arise. The Siret River undergoes an intense regrading of its longitudinal profile, with marked aggradation between transects 24 and 26 (see Figures 1 and 2). This reflects selective accumulation of coarse material due to the massive contribution of the Carpathian tributaries. This phenomenon has been continuous throughout the Holocene, resulting in the gravel sheet formation of the Pericarpathian piedmont.},

Bedload pulsation was immediately noticeable for conditions in which the finer size fraction was poor in the mixture. Three types of bed stateâ€”congested, transitional and smoothâ€”repeated along the channel in an orderly manner; this is the longitudinal sediment sorting.Abundant sand particles thoroughly filled up the interstices of a gravel framework in the smooth state, which in turn invited mixing effects and gave a greater mobility. Sands and gravels were transported rapidly from reaches having the smooth state. An excess of sediment supply, however, was stored within the antecedent congested state, which created a bed surface closely packed by gravel particles. Gravels were intermittently in motion there under these conditions. The longitudinal sediment sorting was also accompanied by aggradingâ€”degrading sequences and/or steep slopeâ€”gentle slope events. A descriptive model applicable to some problems in gravel-bed rivers was obtained.},

The characteristics of longitudinal spreading of clear water discharge and changes in flow depth must be clarified because the changes in peak depth have not yet been examined in steep-slope torrents and because there are few data on spreading of flash floods and related sedimentation in mountainous torrents. In the present study, experimental data were collected through hydraulic model tests over a rigid bed, and the spreading of water, fine sediment, bed load, and large boulders due to flooding are discussed assuming that flash flooding/debris flows occur in the upstream reach. The effects of changes in flow width, such as expansions and contractions in the flow width, as well as changes in meandering channels, sediment transportation, and spreading flow depth resulting from bores are examined using flume data for a steep-slope torrent. The data obtained in the present study reveal that fine sediment components are transported to the downstream reach if large-magnitude floods occur and that the spreading rate and peak lags of the fine sediment and water level indicate the occurrence of a flood in the upstream reach.},

  abstract = {During mountain torrents, large-magnitude floods may result from heavy rainfall and cause the breakage of landslide dams naturally formed by heavy rainfall, earthquakes, and so on. The characteristics of longitudinal spreading of clear water discharge and changes in flow depth must be clarified because the changes in peak depth have not yet been examined in steep-slope torrents and because there are few data on spreading of flash floods and related sedimentation in mountainous torrents. In the present study, experimental data were collected through hydraulic model tests over a rigid bed, and the spreading of water, fine sediment, bed load, and large boulders due to flooding are discussed assuming that flash flooding/debris flows occur in the upstream reach. The effects of changes in flow width, such as expansions and contractions in the flow width, as well as changes in meandering channels, sediment transportation, and spreading flow depth resulting from bores are examined using flume data for a steep-slope torrent. The data obtained in the present study reveal that fine sediment components are transported to the downstream reach if large-magnitude floods occur and that the spreading rate and peak lags of the fine sediment and water level indicate the occurrence of a flood in the upstream reach.},

  abstract = {Asymptotic characteristics of the transport of bed load tracer particles in rivers have been described by advection-dispersion equations. Here we perform numerical simulations designed to study the role of free bars, and more specifically single-row alternate bars, on streamwise tracer particle dispersion. In treating the conservation of tracer particle mass, we use two alternative formulations for the Exner equation of sediment mass conservation: the flux-based formulation, in which bed elevation varies with the divergence of the bed load transport rate, and the entrainment-based formulation, in which bed elevation changes with the net deposition rate. Under the condition of no net bed aggradation/degradation, a 1-D flux-based deterministic model that does not describe free bars yields no streamwise dispersion. The entrainment-based 1-D formulation, on the other hand, models stochasticity via the probability density function (PDF) of particle step length, and as a result does show tracer dispersion. When the formulation is generalized to 2-D to include free alternate bars, however, both models yield almost identical asymptotic advection-dispersion characteristics, in which streamwise dispersion is dominated by randomness inherent in free bar morphodynamics. This randomness can result in a heavy-tailed PDF of waiting time. In addition, migrating bars may constrain the travel distance through temporary burial, causing a thin-tailed PDF of travel distance. The superdiffusive character of streamwise particle dispersion predicted by the model is attributable to the interaction of these two effects.},

  abstract = {Formation and development of alternate bars in an engineered mountainous reach of the Arc River, France, is studied using photo analysis, 1D modelling and by applying theoretical and empirical models for alternate bar systems. Alternate bars already existed in the 80s in the form of a stable confined wandering system. In 1994, the river bed was flattened after engineering works. However, aerial photographs and cross-sectional profiles show that bars rapidly recovered within a few years. The alternate bar system evolved rapidly with a reduction of the number of bars and so an increasing bar length. The width-to-depth ratio, the slope change, the bend upstream of the reach, and the sediment supplies are the main controls of bar formation and evolution. The system appears to lead to force bars due to the bend but also due to a bridge in the downstream part of the reach. Nevertheless some free mobile bars are still observed in the middle of the reach. A discussion on the alternate bar formation is provided using empirical and analytical models. Finally, impacts of low flows and vegetation seem to be significant in the stabilization of the system toward a confined wandering system as observed before the engineering works.},

  abstract = {Major river regulation works have often resulted in alternate bar formation. Experimental work is described which provides more information on this phenomenon. Alternate bar formation is closely associated with meandering, inferring that alternate bar formation is caused by flow induced periodic disturbances of the horizontal velocity profile. Based on these considerations a criterion has been developed which defines the upper limit of alternate bar formation, and this has been satisfactorily compared to other formation criteria and experimental data. The lower limit is given by the initiation of bedload transport. A simple relation between slope, channel width and grain size is then deduced to indicate whether for a given channel, alternate bars can develop for any discharge. This relation takes into account armoring effects. Another equation is proposed to predict the scour depth resulting from alternate bar formation. Such scour often induces costly river maintainance works. Finally, some interesting results on flow resistance have been found, leading to a tentative equation for the intermediate roughness range.},

  abstract = {Abstract The development of threeâ€�dimensional reconstructions of channel morphology has historically been limited by the high costs of geospatial data collection and software modelling. Advances in image processing, sensor technology and portable remoteâ€�sensing platforms, however, now offer the opportunity to derive survey quality terrain models at significantly reduced cost and without traditional deployment and logistical constraints. There is a pressing need to establish whether new geospatial technologies such as structureâ€�fromâ€�motion photogrammetry can be used to deliver topographic data products that are suitable for higherâ€�dimensional hydrodynamic modelling. To address this question, we evaluate the results of simulations using Delft3D that were designed to model distributed, depthâ€�averaged flows in a wide, shallow, gravelâ€�bed braided river. The topography for these simulations was derived from digital elevation models (DEMs) generated using structureâ€�fromâ€�motion and optical bathymetric mapping of two linked reaches of the Ahuriri River, New Zealand. The DEM quality achieved vertical surface errors of 0.10â€‰m in nonâ€�vegetated areas and 0.20â€‰m in inundated areas. Simulations with 1.5â€‰m and 2.5â€‰m resolution grids for lowâ€�flow, mediumâ€�flow and highâ€�flow conditions were calibrated and tested against field realâ€�time kinematicâ€�global navigation satellite system observations. Results revealed that modelled depth errors were comparable to the DEM uncertainty, while simulated and observed inundation patterns achieve a maximum of 81\% agreement. Given the complexity of the braided network and shallow flow depths, these simulations provide a powerful demonstration of the suitability of these terrain models for hydrodynamic applications.

  abstract = {Bed form evolution remains dynamic even in the special case of steady, uniform flow. Data from the sandy, braided North Loup River, Nebraska, show that roughness features on the channel bottom display a statistical steady state and robust scaling that are maintained through the collective interactions of transient (short-lived) bed forms. Motivated by such field data, and laboratory observations of bed form growth, we develop a nonlinear stochastic surface evolution model for the topography of bed load dominated sandy rivers in which instantaneous sediment flux explicitly depends on local elevation and slope. This model quantitatively reproduces laboratory observations of initial growth and saturation of bed forms from a flat surface, and also generates long-term dynamical behavior characteristic of natural systems. We argue that the variability in geometry and kinematics of bed forms in steady flow, and the existence of roughness at all wavelengths up to the largest dunes, are a consequence of the nonlinear relationship between sediment flux and topography, subject to noise.},

  abstract = {Gravel-bed rivers organize to a threshold state in which the fluid stress during dominant flow conditions slightly exceeds the critical value. These channels change fairly abruptly to sand-dominated beds, facilitated by a paucity of sediment in the range of 1!!e!!10 mm. Eolian sediments are also bimodal; sand seas often transition rapidly downwind to silty loess deposits. In this paper we hypothesize that both transitions result from the same processes: (1) production of fine sediment by spallation from saltation abrasion of coarse grains, and (2) segregation of fine and coarse modes by suspension and saltation transport, respectively. We demonstrate that gravel rivers and eolian dune fields are dynamically equivalent in terms of threshold transport (Shields stress) and collision dynamics (Stokes number). While abrasion may not be the dominant cause of downstream fining of fluvial gravels, the reduction of collision efficiency with grain diameter sets a lower limit on gravel size, leading to a grain-size gap. The collision efficiency hypothesis potentially reconciles conflicting studies on the importance of sorting and lithology in downstream fining. Shields and Stokes similitude in rivers and deserts may be used to design appropriately scaled experiments to test and refine our hypothesis.},

It can be used to study steady and unsteady free surface flow, sediment transport, and morphological processes in natural rivers. The efficient element method is applied to discretize the governing equations, and the time marching technique is used for temporal variations. The moving boundaries were treated by locating the wet and dry nodes automatically in the cases of simulating unsteady flows with changing free surface elevation in channels with irregular bed and bank topography. Two eddy viscosity models, a depth-averaged parabolic model and a depth-averaged mixing length model, are used as turbulent closures. Channel morphological changes are computed with considerations of the effects of bed slope and the secondary flow in curved channels. Physical model data have been used to verify this model with satisfactory results. The feasibility studies of simulating morphological formation in meandering channels and flows in natural streams with in-stream structures have been conducted to demonstrate its applicability to hydraulic engineering research/design studies of stream stabilization and ecological quality among other problems.},

It was shown by Liuet al.that WENO schemes constructed from therth order (inL1norm) ENO schemes are (r+ 1)th order accurate. We propose a new way of measuring the smoothness of a numerical solution, emulating the idea of minimizing the total variation of the approximation, which results in a fifth-order WENO scheme for the caser= 3, instead of the fourth-order with the original smoothness measurement by Liuet al.This fifth-order WENO scheme is as fast as the fourth-order WENO scheme of Liuet al.and both schemes are about twice as fast as the fourth-order ENO schemes on vector supercomputers and as fast on serial and parallel computers. For Euler systems of gas dynamics, we suggest computing the weights from pressure and entropy instead of the characteristic values to simplify the costly characteristic procedure. The resulting WENO schemes are about twice as fast as the WENO schemes using the characteristic decompositions to compute weights and work well for problems which do not contain strong shocks or strong reflected waves. We also prove that, for conservation laws with smooth solutions, all WENO schemes are convergent. Many numerical tests, including the 1D steady state nozzle flow problem and 2D shock entropy wave interaction problem, are presented to demonstrate the remarkable capability of the WENO schemes, especially the WENO scheme using the new smoothness measurement in resolving complicated shock and flow structures. We have also applied Yang's artificial compression method to the WENO schemes to sharpen contact discontinuities.},

The analysis of Ikeda and Nishimura (1986), nevertheless, includes an unverified assumption. Herein a more rigorous derivation of the effect is obtained with a minimum of assumptions. The predicted lag appears to be sufficiently small to warrant neglect in natural channels. The theory predicts much higher values in many experimental channels, in agreement with data.

Different types of imbrication are related to particle geometry, flow velocities, flow separation, bed resistance to deformation, contacts of the particles, sediment transport, and time. Stability -- erodibility of the particles at varying orientation is shown to depend on the support, angle of flow attack, particle exposure, and fluctuations of flow directions and tractive force. The response of gravelly sand beds to the flow energy input by development of gravelly transport -- erosion surfaces, gradually stabilizing as imbricated pebble pavements, is demonstrated at different bed slopes under 2- and 3-dimensional geometry. Bed structures and forms of coarse-grained 2- and 3-dimensional delta bodies are related to the flow traction, flow separation, gravity pull, friction, and sediment segregation in backset, topset, foreset and bottomset beds. The results are shown in diagrams and tables. Conclusions and summaries are found at the end of each chapter. A key to interpret the sedimentary environment from textural and structural data is devised in Ch. 10.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Recent advances in the simulation of free surface flows over mobile bed have shown that accurate and stable results in realistic problems can be provided if an appropriate coupling between the shallow water equations (SWE) and the Exner equation is performed. This coupling can be done if using a suitable Jacobian matrix. As a result, faithful numerical predictions are available for a wide range of flow conditions and empirical bed load discharge formulations, allowing to investigate the best option in each case study, which is mandatory in these type of environmental problems. When coupling the equations, the \{SWE\} are considered but including an extra conservation law for the sediment dynamics. In this way the computational cost may become unrealistic in situations where the application of the \{SWE\} over rigid bed can be used involving large time and space scales without giving up to the adequate level of mesh refinement. Therefore, for restoring the numerical efficiency, the coupling technique is simplified, not decreasing the number of waves involved in the Riemann problem but simplifying their definitions. The effects of the approximations made are tested against experimental data which include transient problems over erodible bed. The simplified model is formulated under a general framework able to insert any desirable discharge solid load formula.},

  abstract = {In order to study the morphological evolution of river beds composed of heterogeneous material, the interaction among the different grain sizes must be taken into account. In this paper, these equations are combined with the two-dimensional shallow water equations to describe the flow field. The resulting system of equations can be solved in two ways: (i) in a coupled way, solving flow and sediment equations simultaneously at a given time-step or (ii) in an uncoupled manner by first solving the flow field and using the magnitudes obtained at each time-step to update the channel morphology (bed and surface composition). The coupled strategy is preferable when dealing with strong and quick interactions between the flow field, the bed evolution and the different particle sizes present on the bed surface. A number of numerical difficulties arise from solving the fully coupled system of equations. These problems are reduced by means of a weakly-coupled strategy to numerically estimate the wave celerities containing the information of the bed and the grain sizes present on the bed. Hence, a two-dimensional numerical scheme able to simulate in a self-stable way the unsteady morphological evolution of channels formed by cohesionless grain size mixtures is presented. The coupling technique is simplified without decreasing the number of waves involved in the numerical scheme but by simplifying their definitions. The numerical results are satisfactorily tested with synthetic cases and against experimental data.},

  abstract  = {Field observations in a wide range of environments have shown that sediment availability is a major control on the suspended sediment observations in streams. Here we examine, via laboratory experiments, how the amount of proximal inâ€�channel fine sediment storage relative to the upstream fine sediment distal supply influences the observations of suspended sediment concentrations in streams. Experiments under idealized conditions in a laboratory flume with different ratios of proximal and distal sediment supplies were conducted under a varying flow regime. In addition, the role of the sediment particle size of the supplied sediment on suspended sediment observations was explored. The combinations of proximal and distal sediment supply result in multiple responses of the channel bed and sediment quantity within the channel bed, and the responses adjust through aggradation and degradation. The signature of sediment concentration observed at the upstream section of the channel, given by the distal supply, differs from the downstream observations of the total conveyed sediment (distal and proximal), as shown by an inâ€�phase analysis of sediment concentrationâ€�discharge plots. Furthermore, we show that nonuniform sediment mixtures may result in a change in the direction of the hysteresis observed between sediment concentration and discharge (i.e., from a clockwise hysteresis to a counterclockwise hysteresis). We also demonstrate that the ratio between sediment distal supply and proximal sediment availability modulates the magnitude of the aggradation/degradation processes in the channel reach and thus the joint observations of sediment concentration and discharge. Combinations of proximal and distal sediment supply result in multiple responses of the channel bed (aggradation/degradation) SSC records at the upstream section of the channel (distal supply) differ from the SSC records at the downstream section (distal + proximal) Nonuniform sediment mixtures may result in a change in the direction of the hysteresis observed between SSC and discharge},

  abstract = {A two-dimensional numerical model is developed to predict the time variation of bed deformation in alluvial channel bends. In this model, the depth-averaged unsteady water flow equations along with the sediment continuity equation are solved by using the Beam and Warming alternating-direction implicit scheme. Unlike the present models based on Cartesian or cylindrical coordinate systems and steady flow equations, a body-fitted coordinate system and unsteady flow equations are used so that unsteady effects and natural channels may be modeled accurately. The effective stresses associated with the flow equations are modeled by using a constant eddy-viscosity approach. This study is restricted to beds of uniform particles, i.e., armoring and grain-sorting effects are neglected. To verify the model, the computed results are compared with the data measured in 140Â° and 180Â° curved laboratory flumes with straight reaches up- and downstream of the bend. The model predictions agree better with the measured data than those obtained by previous numerical models. The model is used to investigate the process of evolution and stability of bed deformation in circular bends.},

How recent developments in the statistical theory of extreme values can be applied to improve the rigor of hydrologic applications and to make such analyses more physically meaningful is the central theme of this paper. Such methodological developments primarily relate to maximum likelihood estimation in the presence of covariates, in combination with either the block maxima or peaks over threshold approaches. Topics that are treated include trends in hydrologic extremes, with the anticipated intensification of the hydrologic cycle as part of global climate change. In an attempt to link downscaling (i.e., relating large-scale atmosphere�ocean circulation to smaller-scale hydrologic variables) with the statistics of extremes, statistical downscaling of hydrologic extremes is considered. Future challenges are reviewed, such as the development of more rigorous statistical methodology for regional analysis of extremes, as well as the extension of Bayesian methods to more fully quantify uncertainty in extremal estimation. Examples include precipitation and streamflow extremes, as well as economic damage associated with such extreme events, with consideration of trends and dependence on patterns in atmosphere�ocean circulation (e.g., El Ni�o phenomenon).},

  abstract  = {The compression of peat beneath its own weight (autocompaction) is discussed, and it is shown that because of this process radiocarbondated samples of salt-marsh peat or peaty sediment, other than very thin samples cut from the base of the deposit, cannot be correlated with sea level without construction of a sea-level change curve from other types of data. With rising sea level there is a maximum thickness of salt-marsh peat for any given productivity of marsh grass. Because of this limitation, most marshes older than about 5500 years B.P. have been drowned. An important effect of peat autocompaction is the intrusion of wood into older peat horizons and the juxtaposition of wood of different ages. Wood, therefore, should be avoided in the dating of peat profiles. The roots of salt-marsh plants generally descend a foot or more beneath the rhizomes, contaminating older horizons insofar as radiocarbon dating is concerned. This contamination tends to make dates from marsh samples err on the young side.Sixteen radiocarbon dates from the Boston area are used to construct a sea-level curve going back to 14,000 years B.P. Relative sea level was at +60 feet or higher 14,000 years B.P., dropping sharply to approximately !!e!!70 feet about 10,000 years B.P. From a low of !!e!!70 feet, sea level rose steadily to about !!e!!2 feet approximately 3000 years B.P. Since then sea level appears to have kept close to its present level, probably fluctuating about a foot during the course of the stillstand. A crustal movement curve, based on the relative sea-level curve for Boston and the eustatic curve, indicates that about 290 feet of crustal rise occurred between 14,000!!e!!6000 years B.P., with a maximum rate of uplift of about 0.2 foot per year at 12,750 years B.P., and that from 6000 to 3000 years B.P., crustal subsidence occurred at Boston.},

A critical review of the original sources responsible for this notion of balance in stream work, particularly A. Surell and G. K. Gilbert, reveals that this equilibrium is only a postulate which remains unsupported by observations and that the attributes commonly associated with a graded river, like absence of downward corrasion and efficiency in lateral erosion, are incompatible with the postulate of balance between power and load. Consideration of the common variations in volume of flow and of the importance of turbulence in transportation of debris suggests impossibility of maintenance and even of acquisition of a full load. The customary notion of a graded river as a stream in which equilibrium between power and load is maintained must be discarded, and the term restricted to mean a river without waterfalls and rapids. Discard of this idea of balance in stream work should lead to a better understanding of the role of corrasion, alluviation, and weathering of slopes in valley sculpture.},

  abstract  = {The stability of bedforms in mixtures of gravel and sand is not well understood. Two bedform types are characteristic: flow-parallel sand ribbons and flow-transverse barchans. Flume experiments and field data presented here show that gradual transitions exist from sand ribbons to barchans, and from barchans to fully developed dunes. Barchans and sand ribbons occur when not enough transportable sediment is available for the formation of fully developed ripples or dunes. The reason is that a part of the bed sediment is immobile, e.g., with an armor layer, which limits the sediment supply and thus the volume of sediment available for the formation of bedforms.Bedform stability diagrams are shown to be extendable to sediment supply-limited bedforms in sand-gravel sediment, if the particle parameters of the diagrams are derived from the transported sediment instead of the bed sediment. Barchans and forms transitional to fully developed dunes plot in the dune stability fields. Sand ribbons, on the other hand, plot in the ripple, lower plane bed, and dune fields.In the case of sediment supply limitation, bedforms are partly or completely related to the characteristics of the sediment supply from upstream. The sediment underlying the bedforms may be a stable armor and the exchange of sediment between this armor and the bedforms may be small or non-existent. Consequently, bedform characteristics in sand-gravel mixtures in supply-limited conditions often are not predictable from the local hydraulics and sediment characteristics.},

  abstract = {River bifurcations are critical but poorly understood elements of many geomorphological systems. They are integral elements of alluvial fans, braided rivers, fluvial lowland plains, and deltas and control the partitioning of water and sediment through these systems. Bifurcations are commonly unstable but their lifespan varies greatly. In braided rivers bars and channels migrate, split and merge at annual or shorter timescales, thereby creating and abandoning bifurcations. This behaviour has been studied mainly by geomorphologists and fluid dynamicists. Bifurcations also exist during avulsion, the process of a river changing course on a floodplain or in a delta, which may take 102!!e!!103 years and has been studied mainly by sedimentologists. This review synthesizes our current understanding of bifurcations and brings together insights from different research communities and different environmental settings. We consider the causes and initiation of bifurcations and avulsion, the physical mechanisms controlling bifurcation and avulsion evolution, mathematical and numerical modelling of these processes, and the possibility of stable bifurcations. We end the review with some open questions. Copyright !!e!! 2012 John Wiley  \&  Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract  = {Although forecast by the National Company of the RhÃ´ne,  the floods of February 1990, caused by the overflowing of the 'old RhÃ´ne', produced unusual afects on the Chautagne marsh. An hypothesis was formulated that movements of the bed of the old RhÃ´ne were responsible for this condition. This led the Syndicate of Defense of Embankments and Borders of the Upper RhÃ´ne to request a morphodynamic study, which is presented here in condensed manner. The hydroelectric diversion scheme has little effect on the transit of flood flows in the old RhÃ´ne but has stopped the transit of bed load, which had been left strongly reduced by the works completed upriver prior to the 20th century. Analysis of available data shows evidence of a lowering of the longitudinal profile, rendered complex by the fact that the Rhone's course is influenced by a morphology of fluvial braiding moderately affected by old dykes. Sediment transport is initiated by a flow of approximately 400 m3/s and occurs on average only three days per year. The bed degradation extends itself progressively through space whenever the flood discharge occurs, but with a reduced recurrence interval. The analysis demonstrates that the movement of coarse material will continue into the future. In order to maintain the flooding of the marsh, the water line for minimum discharge and the level of the water table in the old RhÃ´ne, civil engineering work is recommended. Its purpose is to minimize the transport that affects the final supply of bedload and to ensure a sustainable development of the floodplain.},

Recently, the validity of Qe as an overall descriptor of sediment transport has been questioned because of its various interpretations and methods of calculation. A new discharge index termed the half-load discharge, Q1/2 was introduced as the discharge above and below which half of the total sediment load has been transported over time. Existing methods along with long records of continuous daily suspended sediment and discharge data are used to clarify what a discharge index can accomplish. We also offer an objective and consistent empirical methodology for calculating Qe based on a kernel density function. Generalized graphical relationships are introduced for summarizing the frequency and magnitude of both stream discharge and sediment loads. We document how Qe and Q1/2 are related to standard descriptors of river discharge as well as general characteristics of the sediment load-discharge relationship.},

  abstract  = {Alternate bars may form in sandy beds of straight rivers and channels. These bars are characterized by the alternation of crests, all moving downstream at a speed of several meters per day. The aim of this paper is to predict the dynamics of alternate bars. To that end, we tested predictions of measured alternate bars in flume experiments, as derived from an amplitude evolution model. Weakly nonlinear stability analysis underlies this amplitude evolution model, so that it applies to situations in which the width-to-depth ratio is close to the critical ratio, above which alternate bars occur. The experiments have a width-to-depth ratio far above the critical value, well outside the range of formal validity of the model. While wavelengths and heights of the alternate bars are still well predicted, we found that the migration rate is not: the amplitude evolution model produces an underestimation of close to a factor of two. Therefore we took a slightly different approach. We tested the predictive capability for this amplitude evolution model by using a genetic algorithm to tune the model to bathymetric data. After tuning, the model is indeed able to predict the migration rate of the bars over periods that exceed the tuning period by far. Limits to the prediction time, i.e., failure of this method, could not be derived for the data sets used in this work.},

  abstract  = {More than 40 million cubic metres of mining waste were supplied to the Ringarooma River between 1875 and 1984, leading to successive phases of aggradation and degradation. The natural bed material is gravel but, given the volume of introduced load and the fact that much of the input was less than 5 mm in diameter, the size composition of the bed changed from gravel to sand during the phase of downstream progressive aggradation. A very sharp gravel-sand transition developed in which median grain size decreased from over 30 mm to under 3 mm in less than 500 m. With upstream supplies of mining debris becoming depleted first, degradation followed the same downstream progressive pattern as aggradation, causing the transition to migrate downstream. By 1984, the river could be regarded as a series of zones, each characterized by a particular bed condition: a natural cobble-gravel bed, unaffected by mining inputs (0-32 km); pre-disturbance bed re-exposed by degradation over 35-40 years (32-53 km); sandy substrate with a gravel armour produced by differential transport during degradation (53-65 km); sand dominated but with developing surface patches of coarser material (65-75 km); sandy bed reflecting the size composition of the original mining input (75-118 km). Although the gravel!!e!!sand transition itself is sharp, the transitional zone is lengthy (53-75 km). As degradation continues, the gravel-sand transition is expected to progress downstream but it has remained in a stable position for 12 years. Indeed, two major floods during the period released large quantities of sand from the sub-armour layer and newly-formed banks of mine tailings, causing fining both above and below the transition. Surface grain size is an adjustable component in the transitional zone as the river strives to recover from a major anthropogenic disturbance.},

The possible failure of ellipticity of the appropriate system of displacement equations of equilibrium at solutions involving large deformations was suggested by certain difficulties encountered in an attempt to determine the deformations and stresses arising in such a material near the tip of a crack. It is shown here that ellipticity prevails only if the principal stretches are suitably restricted and breaks down, in particular, at a local state of uni-axial tension or compression of sufficiently severe intensity.},

  abstract =  {The concept of flow competence is generally employed to evaluate velocities and bed stresses of river floods from the sizes of the largest sediment particles transported. For the most part, this evaluation has been empirical, combining data from a number of separate flood events in different river systems. Those data are re-examined and compared with empirical equations for the selective entrainment of gravel from deposits of mixed sizes. It is found that the competence relationships trend counter to those obtained for selective entrainment, indicating that the competence evaluations are affected by varying degrees of selective size entrainment. Individual data sets which have been employed to establish the flow-competence relationships either show no trend on their own or yield a trend which runs counter to the competence equation, instead being more compatible with the selective-entrainment relationships. In most instances, the empirical competence equations greatly overestimate the hydraulics of flood flows, and it is suggested that the better established selective entrainment equations be used for competence evaluations as well. Empirical equations are available for this purpose, relating the dimensionless Shields entrainment function or the bed shear stress to the diameter of the largest grain moved and to the median diameter of the deposit as a whole.},

Measurements of three-dimensional velocity are made with an acoustic Doppler current profiler whilst suspended sediment concentration and particle size have been quantified using a laser in situ sediment scattering transmissometer. Suspended sediment concentration and streamwise and vertical sediment flux are highest close to the bed, with an upward vertical flux over the stoss side of the dune and downward flux over the lee side. Suspended sediment concentrations are higher over the crest compared with the trough and suspended sediment is coarsest near the bed. About 17\% of the suspended-load transported over the crest is deposited in the lee side before it reaches the trough. Most of this deposited sand is coarser sediment that originates close to the bed over the crest, a result consistent with simulations based on the model of Mohrig and Smith (Water Resources Research 1996; 32: 3207â€“3217) for the excursion lengths of sediment dispersed in the lee side of a dune.

The transport of bed load was measured on Goodwin Creek, and in a laboratory flume channel with a similar bed material size distribution. The range of bed load transport rates measured in the laboratory channel were similar to those measured in the channel of Goodwin Creek; however, the shear stresses calculated on Goodwin Creek were three times greater than in the laboratory channel for similar bed load transport rates. Much of this difference in shear stress was removed by applying the drag partitioning technique of Einstein, although significant differences between the two sets of data remain. Predictions of bed load transport rates using three previously published transport relations were good for most flows for the laboratory data. For the Goodwin Creek bed load data, predicted transport rates were close to measured ones for low flows but diverged by an order of magnitude or more for high shear stresses. Improved methods of shear stress partitioning are needed to improve the performance of bed load transport relations on streams of this type.},

Two water recirculating sediment feed flumes were used: one with a 6 m long and 0.15 m wide channel and other with an 11 m long channel with widths of 0.74 m and 0.53 m. The sediment, poorly sorted gravel with a mean size of 3 mm, was fed at the upstream end of the channel at steady rates from 0.03 kg s!!e!!1 m!!e!!1 to 1.0 kg s!!e!!1 m!!e!!1. Sediment transport rate out of the channel varied in all runs, at approximate periods of 3 min in the runs with high transport rates to 14 min in the runs with low transport rates. The runs with low transport rates also showed fluctuations in total transport rate at periods of about 25 min. Transport rates of each size fraction varied with time in a distinctive pattern in all runs. The time variations were caused by the migration of very long and low bed load sheets in the runs with low to moderate transport rates and dunelike bed forms in the run with the highest transport rate. The bed surface in all runs was coarser in size than the original sediment mix except that with the highest transport rate (run H5) in which the size distribution was nearly the same as the original.},

However, interfacial forces such as the interfacial pressure term and the virtual mass force, bringing new differential terms to the system, can change the analysis and make the problem hyperbolic. The aim of this paper is to define how the interfacial pressure default force affects the hyperbolicity of a general multifield model, and consequently, its inherent numerical stability. We characterize the location of the non hyperbolic regions and propose a closure for the interfacial pressure that makes the system hyperbolic in physically relevant regions.},

  abstract = {In this study, the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods for determining the dispersion coefficient in the two-dimensional river mixing model were assessed based on hydraulic and tracer data sets acquired from experiments conducted on either laboratory channels or natural rivers. From the results of this study, it can be concluded that, when the longitudinal dispersion coefficient as well as the transverse dispersion coefficients must be determined in the transient concentration situation, the two-dimensional routing procedures, 2D RP and 2D STRP, can be employed to calculate dispersion coefficients among the observation methods. For the steady concentration situation, the STRP can be applied to calculate the transverse dispersion coefficient. When the tracer data are not available, either theoretical or empirical equations by the estimation method can be used to calculate the dispersion coefficient using the geometric and hydraulic data sets. Application of the theoretical and empirical equations to the laboratory channel showed that equations by Baek and Seo [[3], 2011] predicted reasonable values while equations by Fischer [23] and Boxwall and Guymer (2003) overestimated by factors of ten to one hundred. Among existing empirical equations, those by Jeon et al. [28] and Baek and Seo [6] gave the agreeable values of the transverse dispersion coefficient for most cases of natural rivers. Further, the theoretical equation by Baek and Seo [5] has the potential to be broadly applied to both laboratory and natural channels.},

  abstract = {We examined the role of bed sediment size, bank materials, riparian vegetation, and discharge on channel form along a 10-km reach of the Upper Tualatin River, encompassing both gravel and sand-bed reaches. Statistical correlations and analyses of downstream changes of channel morphology reveal that bank materials and bed sediment are the dominant controls on channel cross section form. A rapid downstream reduction in bed sediment size in the gravel-bed channel is followed by an abrupt transition to a narrower, deeper, and less sinuous sand-bed channel with more cohesive bank materials. The simultaneous reductions in channel slope, bed sediment size, and width-to-depth ratio indicate the channel crosses a geomorphic threshold to maintain continuity in sediment transport. This gravel-to-sand transition and associated change in channel form are induced by a break in valley slope and an increase in bank resistance from cohesive bank materials. Bank materials, measured as the average percent silt and clay in banks, are a primary influence on channel form within both subreaches but demonstrate a greater influence on channel width and vertical stability in the gravel-bed channel and on channel depth and lateral stability in the sand-bed channel. Riparian vegetation at current densities and compositions is not a significant control on contemporary channel cross section form and may be responding to the bank and channel stability provided by cohesive bank materials in the laterally dynamic gravel-bed channel.},

  abstract = {Deltas form over basements of various slope configurations. While the morphodynamics of prograding deltas over single-slope basements have been studied previously, our understanding of delta progradation over segmented basements is still limited. Here we use experimental and analytical approaches to investigate the deltaic morphologies developing over two-slope basements with unequal subaerial and subaqueous slopes. For each case considered, the scaled profiles of the evolving delta collapse to a single profile for constant water and sediment influxes, allowing us to use the analytical self-similar profiles to investigate the individual effects of subaerial/subaqueous slopes. Individually varying the subaerial/subaqueous slopes exerts asymmetric effects on the morphologies. Increasing the subaerial slope advances the entire delta; increasing the subaqueous slope advances the upstream boundary of the topset yet causes the downstream boundary to retreat. The delta front exhibits a first-retreat-then-advance migrating trend with increasing subaqueous slope. A decrease in subaerial topset length is always accompanied by an increase in subaqueous volume fraction, no matter which segment is steepened. Applications are presented for estimating shoreline retreat caused by steepening of basement slopes, and estimating subaqueous volume and delta front using the observed topset length. The results may have implications for real-world delta systems subjected to upstream tectonic uplift and/or downstream subsidence. Both scenarios would exhibit reduced topset lengths, which are indicative of the accompanied increases in subaqueous volume and signal tectonic uplift and/or subsidence that are at play. We highlight herein the importance of geometric controls on partitioning of sediment between subaerial and subaqueous delta components.},

  abstract =  {We report an experimental investigation of the motion of bed load particles under steady and spatially uniform turbulent flow above a flat sediment bed of uniform grain size. Using a high-speed video imaging system, we recorded the trajectories of the moving particles and measured their velocity and the length and duration of their flights, as well as the surface density of the moving particles. Our observations show that entrained particles exhibit intermittent motion composed of the succession of periods of !!e!!flight!!e!!? and periods of rest. During one flight, a particle may go through phases of reptation, during which it moves in nearly persistent contact with the rough bed, and phases of saltation, during which it travels sufficiently high above the bed to reach high velocities. The distributions of longitudinal and transverse particle velocities obey a decreasing exponential and a Gaussian law, respectively. Interestingly, these observations are similar to those previously reported for viscous flows. The experimental results presented here support the erosion-deposition model of Charru (2006) and allow the calibration of the involved coefficients. In particular, noting !!e!!*, the Shields number, and !!e!!*c, the threshold Shields number, we find that (1) the surface density of moving particles increases linearly with !!e!!* !!e!! !!e!!*c; (2) the average particle velocity increases linearly with !!e!!*1/2 !!e!! !!e!!*c1/2, with a finite nonzero value at the threshold; (3) the flight duration scales with a characteristic settling time with no significant dependence on either !!e!!* or the settling Reynolds number; and (4) the flight length increases linearly with !!e!!*1/2 !!e!! !!e!!*c1/2. The results presented in this paper should provide a valuable physical framework to describe bed form development in turbulent flows.},

  abstract = {Median grain sizes on riverbeds range from boulders in uplands to silt in lowlands; however, rivers with ~1�5?mm diameter bed sediment are rare. This grain size gap also marks an abrupt transition between gravel- and sand-bedded reaches that is unlike any other part of the fluvial network. Abrupt gravel-sand transitions have been attributed to rapid breakdown or rapid transport of fine gravel, or a bimodal sediment supply, but supporting evidence is lacking. Here we demonstrate that rivers dramatically lose the ability to transport sand as wash load where bed shear velocity drops below ~0.1?m/s, forcing an abrupt transition in bed-material grain size. Using thresholds for wash load and initial motion, we show that the gap emerges only for median bed-material grain sizes of ~1�5?mm due to Reynolds number dependencies in suspension transport. The grain size gap, therefore, is sensitive to material properties and gravity, with coarser gaps predicted on Mars and Titan.},

The interaction between small-scale and large-scale bed forms is found to enhance a modulation in time and in space of the bar pattern. Moreover, the flow depth decrease experienced by the flow field when approaching bar fronts, leading to a progressive reduction of the dimensions of small-scale bed forms, may influence appreciably the overall flow resistance. Experimental values of bar wavelength and of bar celerity are compared with the theoretical estimates obtained from a model developed within the classical framework of linear stability analysis. In particular, the model accounts for the local variability of friction coefficient and water level, for the secondary helical flow effects, and for the influence of longitudinal slope on sediment transport. Quantitatively satisfactory predictions of bar wavelength appear to be possible in spite of the fact that in various runs a correct estimation of flow resistance and flow discharge appears to be relatively difficult.},

  abstract = {Laboratory experiments have been carried out in a large laboratory flume using a strongly bimodal sediment mixture in a range of flow conditions such that the initially flat bed of the flume became unstable enhancing the development of alternate bars. In order to elucidate the effect of grain sorting, the present experiments are compared with a previous set of experiments performed in the same flume under similar hydraulic conditions but using a nearly uniform sand with a mean geometric grain diameter equal to that characterizing present experiments. The comparison suggests that sediment heterogeneity may appreciably affect bed form characteristics. The development of smallscale (ripples) and mesoscale (dunes) sediment waves tended to be inhibited thus allowing a decrease in flow resistance. Owing to the bimodal character of the adopted mixture at low values of the bed shear stress a condition of partial transport was attained for which only the finer-grained portion of the mixture was observed to move, while the coarsergrained fractions remained essentially immobile throughout the experimental run. However, complete mobilization of all size fractions was observed to occur in runs carried out at higher slopes (i.e., at higher bed shear stress) in order to generate an alternate bar pattern. Selective transport of individual grain size fractions, coupled with the characteristic bar topography pattern led to an intense longitudinal sorting which accreted the coarser particles on bar crests. Furthermore, bar migration caused, through scour and fill, a significant vertical sorting. As a consequence of these sorting processes and in accordance with previous experimental observations, bar height turns out to be invariably damped with respect to uniform sediment experiments. The trend exhibited by the wavelengths is less clear and suggests that in the present experiments sorting effects do not enhance the clear shortening of bar wavelengths typically observed in other series of flume experiments carried out with weakly bimodal mixtures.},

  abstract  = {Like most media, open channel flows propagate information through waves. When the channel boundary is fixed, the vectors of information consist typically of surface gravity waves. In the less straightforward case of channels with cohesionless bed and possibly erodible banks, other types of waves arise from the erodible nature of the boundaries and the ability of the stream to transport sediments. In this paper we restrict our attention to the important case of long waves, which can be described by employing the shallow water approximation for the flow field and a quasi-equilibrium assumption for sediment transport on weakly sloping beds. We focus on a major issue: In which direction is information propagated? This is a problem raised and partially solved by de Vries in the context of one-dimensional morphological modeling as early as 1965. We review some of the available knowledge on this subject, viewed in a more general context where vectors of information can be a variety of waves: purely longitudinal one-dimensional sediment waves, two-dimensional waves driven by large-scale bed forms (bars), and plan form waves carrying information related to the planform shape of the channel. Both linear and nonlinear, migrating and stationary waves are considered. It turns out that the role played by the Froude number in determining the direction of one-dimensional perturbations of bed topography is somewhat taken by the aspect ratio of the channel when large-scale two-dimensional bed forms as well as planform waves are considered.},

  abstract = {Bend instability is the process whereby perturbations of the planform distribution of a channel relative to a straight configuration may grow, driven by erosion at concave banks and deposition at convex banks, leading to the development of a meandering pattern. Here we investigate the nature of this instability; that is, we ascertain under what conditions bend instability is convective or absolute. In the former case, an initial nonpersistent, small perturbation localized in space is convected away, eventually leaving the flow domain unperturbed. In the latter case, perturbations spread in both the upstream and downstream directions, eventually affecting the whole flow domain. In convective instabilities, the spatial-temporal development of perturbations is somewhat dependent on the characteristics of the initial perturbation which is required to be persistent in time. On the contrary, absolute instabilities are able to amplify perturbations, even if triggered at some initial time and then ceased. If bend instability is convective, planform information migrates only in one direction, while in the absolute regime, information is propagated in both directions. We show that bend instability is most often, though not invariably, convective at both a linear and nonlinear level. Moreover, the group velocity of perturbations changes sign as the width to depth ratio of the channel crosses some threshold value (the resonant value of Blondeaux and Seminara (1985)): Below (above) resonance, information is propagated downstream (upstream). We discuss the implications that these findings have on the morphological characteristics of meandering rivers (in particular, the sense of skewing of meander bends and the direction of meander migration). We also clarify how the choice of appropriate boundary conditions in numerical simulations of planform evolution is crucially dependent on the nature of bend instability and on its subresonant or superresonant regime.},

These variations are essentially related to the presence of the channel banks and to the planform configuration of the channel.

This paper deals with very pragmatic techniques aiming at the reduction of this computational cost in the case of tidal current situations. In the first part, the reduction in the number of distinct events to be simulated is investigated, by selecting a limited set of natural situations which affect the bed like the whole actual set of tidal situations would do. Then methods for computation, at a reasonable cost, of the flow perturbations induced by the bed changes are presented: they make it possible to avoid too frequent complete re-computation of the hydrodynamics during long-term simulations. Finally, four methods aiming at the increase of the effective morphological time step are described and tested; as a matter of fact, they lead to quite cheaper computations, while the error specifically linked to this time schematization remains quite small.},

  abstract = {A theory for the movement of suspendible sediment through the floodplain of a simple actively migrating river is developed. The floodplain is represented as a series of sediment storage reservoirs, each incorporating multiple bends of a river. Independent models for floodplain sediment deposition and for subsequent removal of sediment by lateral channel migration allow the volume of sediment stored in the floodplain (and the associated average floodplain elevation) to change over time and down the valley. At a given quasi-steady discharge, deposition depends on a simple one-dimensional partition between channel and floodplain discharge and on suspended sediment concentration (one size class) which varies along the reach depending on lateral supply and floodplain history. Sediment supply is specified at the upstream end of the reach using a suspended sediment rating curve. Long-term average overbank deposition rates are approximated by weighting multiple steady state solutions using a flow duration curve. The channel bed elevation of the system is assumed to be fixed, and tributaries are handled using simple lateral source terms. The interaction between the submodels is such that under constant boundary conditions, the channel evolves toward a state of geomorphic equilibrium where the volume of sediment added to the floodplain by overbank deposition just balances the volume removed by channel migration. The model is easily adapted to track conservative suspended sediment tracer material concentration as such material moves through the channel/floodplain system.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Bed material transported in geomorphically active gravel bed rivers often has a local source at nearby eroding banks and ends up sequestered in bars not far downstream. However, most 1-D numerical models for gravel transport assume that gravel originates from and deposits on the channel bed. In this paper, we present a 1-D framework for simulating morphodynamic evolution of bed elevation and size distribution in a gravel-bed river that actively exchanges sediment with its floodplain, which is represented as an off-channel sediment reservoir. The model is based on the idea that sediment enters the channel at eroding banks whose elevation depends on total floodplain sediment storage and on the average elevation of the floodplain relative to the channel bed. Lateral erosion of these banks occurs at a specified rate that can represent either net channel migration or channel widening. Transfer of material out of the channel depends on a typical bar thickness and a specified lateral exchange rate due either to net channel migration or narrowing. The model is implemented using an object oriented framework that allows users to explore relationships between bank supply, bed structure, and lateral change rates. It is applied to a !!e!!50-km reach of the Ain River, France, that experienced significant reduction in sediment supply due to dam construction during the 20th century. Results are strongly sensitive to lateral exchange rates, showing that in this reach, the supply of sand and gravel at eroding banks and the sequestration of gravel in point bars can have strong influence on overall reach-scale sediment budgets.},

  abstract = {Rivers have been trained for centuries by channel narrowing and straightening. This caused important damages to their ecosystems, particularly around the bank areas. We analyze here the possibility to train rivers in a new way by subdividing their channel in main and ecological channel with a longitudinal training wall. The effectiveness of longitudinal training walls in achieving this goal and their long-term effects on the river morphology have not been thoroughly investigated yet. In particular, studies that assess the stability of the two parallel channels separated by the training wall are still lacking. This work studies the long-term morphological developments of river channels subdivided by a longitudinal training wall in the presence of steady alternate bars. This type of bars, common in alluvial rivers, alters the flow field and the sediment transport direction and might affect the stability of the bifurcating system. The work comprises both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations (Delft3D). The results show that a system of parallel channels divided by a longitudinal training wall has the tendency to become unstable. An important factor is found to be the location of the upstream termination of the longitudinal wall with respect to a neighboring steady bar. The relative widths of the two parallel channels separated by the wall and variable discharge do not substantially change the final evolution of the system.},

  abstract = {To maintain a navigable channel and improve high-flow conveyance, engineers have recently proposed constructing longitudinal training walls as an alternative to the traditional transverse groynes. However, previous work has shown that the system of parallel channels created by a longitudinal training wall might be unstable in rivers with alternate bars. Many questions remain unanswered, particularly whether a stable system can be obtained by carefully designing the bifurcation point. This work analyses the stability of the bifurcating system created by a thin longitudinal wall in sand-bed rivers with alternate bars or point bars. The methodology includes performing 102 numerical tests using the Delft3D code to reproduce an idealized low-land river, either straight or meandering. The results show that the system of parallel channels separated by a training wall may indeed become unstable. An important factor is found to be the location of the bifurcation point with respect to a neighboring bar or point bar. The same trends are observed for both constant and variable discharge, in straight and meandering channels. The results suggest that cyclic growth and decline of the bifurcating channels may arise as inherent system behavior, without the need of any additional external forcing. We explain this from changes in the relationship between sediment transport ratio and discharge ratio as the bifurcation evolves. This cyclic behavior can be regarded as a form of system stability and can be obtained by carefully placing the starting point of the longitudinal training wall, and thus the bifurcation point, near the top of a bar.},

  abstract  = {The rate of sediment supply from erosional catchment to depositional basin depends primarily upon climate, relief, catchment slope and lithology. It varies in both time and space. Spatial changes in erosion rates due to variations in lithology are illustrated by contrasting rates of drainage divide migration away from faults of known ages. Time variations in relative sediment supply are extremely complex and vary widely according to the direction and magnitude of climate change. In many parts of the Great Basin and south-western USA, glacial maximum climates were characterized by higher effective moisture and the altitudinal downward spread of woods and forests. Sparse data from alluvial fans indicate reduced sediment supply, despite the increased runoff evident from higher lake levels. The situation in Mediterranean areas is less clear, with rival climatic scenarios for vegetation ecotypes predicting contrasting runoff. In order to test these latter we run Cumulative Seasonal Erosion Potential [CSEP] experiments for present-day and a variety of full-glacial Mediterranean candidate climates. The results indicate the likelihood of enhanced sediment supply and runoff compared to the present day during full-glacial times for a cool wet winter climate and a reduction in sediment supply and runoff for a full-glacial cool dry winter climate. We then explore the consequences of such phase differences in sediment supply, and sea and lake levels for the stratigraphy of sedimentary basins. Highstands and lowstands of sea or lake may be accompanied by greater or lesser sediment and water supply, as determined by the regional climate and the direction of climatic change. Thus marine lowstands are not necessarily periods of great transfer of coarse clastic sediments to shelves and deep water basinal environments. Unsteady sediment supply has greatest implications for alluvial systems, in particular the effect that changing relative supplies of water and sediment have upon river and fan channel incision.},

  abstract = {The spatial referencing of river channels is complicated by their meandering planform, which dictates that Euclidean distance in a Cartesian reference frame is not an appropriate metric. Channel-fitted coordinate systems are thus widely used in application-oriented geostatistics as well as theoretical fluid mechanics, where flow patterns are described in terms of a streamwise axis s along the channel centerline and an axis n normal to that centerline. A means of transforming geographic (x, y) coordinates to their equivalents in the (s, n) space and vice versa is needed to relate the two frames of reference, and this paper describes a pair of transformation algorithms that are explicitly intended for reach-scale studies of modern rivers. The forward transformation from Cartesian to channel-fitted coordinates involves parametric description of the centerline using cubic splines, calculation of centerline normal vectors and curvature using results from differential geometry, and an efficient local search to find in-channel data points and compute their (s, n) coordinates. The inverse transformation finds the nearest vertices of a discretized centerline and uses a finite difference approximation to the streamwise rates of change of the centerline's Cartesian coordinates to obtain the geographic equivalent of a point in the (s, n) space. The performance of these algorithms is evaluated using: (i) field data from a gravel-bed river to examine the effects of initial centerline digitization and subsequent filtering; and (ii) analytically-defined centerlines and simulated coordinates to assess transformation accuracy and sensitivity to centerline curvature and discretization. Any discrepancy between a point's known coordinates in one frame of reference and the coordinates produced via transformation from the other coordinate system constitutes a transformation error, and our results indicate that these errors are 2--4{\%} and 0.2--0.5{\%} of the channel width for the field case and simulated centerlines, respectively. The primary sources of transformation error are the initial digitization of the centerline and the relationship between centerline curvature and discretization.},

In order to achieve a better understanding of channel-forming conditions in high-gradient, boulder-bed streams, the long-term sediment loads data obtained from the Rio Cordon (Italian Alps) measuring station have been analysed. The effective discharge (Qe, calculated using both Wolman and Miller's method and the so-called !!e!!mean!!e!! approach) for bedload transport proves to be more appropriate than that determined for the suspended sediment load in describing the channel formation and maintenance for this type of channels. The analysis demonstrates that Qe is strongly influenced by the number of flow classes, the fraction of transported sediments and the methodology used in its computation. The result questions the appropriateness in considering Qe as an unique value, and also suggests the possible definition of two dominant discharge ranges for steep mountain rivers: (a) a relatively frequent flow range responsible for maintaining channel form; and (b) a more infrequent high flow range responsible for macro-scale channel shaping.},

In practice, state-of-the-art computer models are one- or two-dimensional (depth-averaged) and have a limited ability to model many of the important three-dimensional flow phenomena found in nature. This paper presents the implementation and validation of sediment transport formulations within the proven \{DELFT3D\} three-dimensional (hydrostatic, free surface) flow solver. The paper briefly discusses the operation of the DELFT3D-FLOW module, presents the key features of the formulations used to model both suspended and bedload transport of noncohesive sediment, and describes the implemented morphological updating scheme. The modeling of the three-dimensional effects of waves is also discussed. Following the details of the implementation, the results of a number of validation studies are presented. The model is shown to perform well in several theoretical, laboratory, and real-life situations.},

  abstract  = {High-resolution morphological modeling of fluvial processes with complex, rapidly varying flows has been limited so far by model accuracy or computational efficiency. One of the most widely used numerical algorithms is based on the total variation diminishing method, solved by either upwind or centered approaches. An upwind scheme preserves high accuracy but is complex and computationally demanding, whereas the simplicity and efficiency of a centered approach compromise the accuracy. The present paper extends a recent upwind-biased centered scheme originally developed for clear water and scalar transport over a rigid bed, to sediment-laden flows over an erodible bed. It does so by developing a fully coupled 2-D mathematical model using a finite volume method for structured grids. The complete set of noncapacity-based governing equations, involving the effects of bed deformation and sediment density variation, as well as the influences of turbulence and sediment diffusion, and the temporal and spatial scales needed for sediment adaptation, is solved at one time to obtain synchronous solutions for the entire computational domain. For stability, a two-stage splitting approach together with a second-order Runge-Kutta method is employed for the source terms. The model is verified in a number of tests covering a wide range of complex (sediment-laden) flows. The model is demonstrated to accurately simulate shock waves and reflection waves, but also rapid bed deformations at high sediment transport rates. The combination of high numerical accuracy and computational efficiency makes the model an important tool to forecast flood events in morphologically complex areas.},

Here we demonstrate a novel finding: when bankfull shear velocity and bankfull depth are correlated against bed material grain size and bed slope, they are to first order independent of grain size and dependent on water viscosity. We demonstrate this using a similarity collapse for bankfull Shields number as a function of slope and grain size, obtained with data for 230 river reaches ranging from silt-bed to cobble-bed. Our analysis shows that bankfull Shields number increases with slope to about the half power. We show that the new relation for bankfull Shields number provides more realistic predictions for the downstream variation of bankfull characteristics of rivers than a previously used assumption of constant bankfull Shields number.},

  abstract = {Abstract Twenty runs of experiments are carried out to investigate non-equilibrium transport of graded and uniform bed load sediment in a degrading channel. Well-sorted gravel and sand are employed to compose four kinds of sediment beds with different gravel/sand contents, i.e., uniform 100% gravel bed, uniform 100% sand bed, and two graded sediment beds respectively with 53% gravel and 47% sand as well as 22% gravel and 78% sand. For different sediment beds, the experiments are conducted under the same discharges, thereby allowing for the role of sediment composition in dictating the bed load transport rate to be identified. A new observed dataset is generated concerning the flow, sediment transport and evolution of bed elevation and composition, which can be exploited to underpin developments of mathematical river models. The data shows that in a degrading channel, the sand greatly promotes the transport of gravel, whilst the gravel considerably hinders the transport of sand. The promoting and hindering effects are evaluated by means of impact factors defined based on sediment transport rates. The impact factors are shown to vary with flow discharge by orders of magnitude, being most pronounced at the lowest discharge. It is characterized that variations in sand or gravel inputs as a result of human activities and climate change may lead to severe morphological changes in degrading channels.},

Generating synthetic flood events according to statistical properties of observations is one of plausible methods to analyze the flood frequency. Due to the statistical dependence among the flood event variables (i.e. the flood peak, volume and duration), a multidimensional joint probability estimation is required. Recently, the copula method is widely used for multivariable dependent structure construction, however, the copula family should be chosen before application and the choice process is sometimes rather subjective. The entropy copula, a new copula family, employed in this research proposed a way to avoid the relatively subjective process by combining the theories of copula and entropy. The analysis shows the effectiveness of the entropy copula for probabilistic modelling the flood events of two hydrological gauges, and a comparison of accuracy with the popular copulas was made. The Gibbs sampling technique was applied for trivariate flood events simulation in order to mitigate the calculation difficulties of extending to three dimension directly. The simulation results indicate that the entropy copula is a simple and effective copula family for trivariate flood simulation.},

  abstract = {Abstract The downstream peak discharge increase during hyperconcentrated floods in the Yellow River has been attributed to bed erosion, roughness reduction and floodplain effects. While great improvements have been made on the understandings of the roles of bed erosion and roughness reduction, the effects of floodplain remain poorly understood. Here, as a first step to reveal the floodplain effects, we present a numerical experimental study on how the channel-floodplain system reacts to a hyperconcentrated flood process. For this purpose, schematized channel-floodplain systems are designed and the classical 1992 flood record data is prescribed at the upstream boundary. By applying a fully coupled morphodynamic model, numerical experiments are conducted for a comprehensive analysis on the effects of bed erodibility, floodplain width, bed roughness variation, symmetry and longitudinal variability of geomorphology. Our results show two distinct trends for the response of channel- floodplain system depending on bed erodibility. For a small bed erodibility, both channel and floodplain experience erosion. For a moderate/large bed erodibility, only the channel experiences erosion whereas deposition occurs on the floodplain. The variation of the floodplain width does not affect these erosion-deposition behaviors while changing the magnitude and patterns of floodplain deposition. The longitudinally discontinuous channel-floodplain divided by either water storage areas or housing/farming banks diminishes the floodplain deposition at the discontinuous locations. The present numerical experiments do not show an obvious peak discharge increase, nonetheless, the recognized erosion-deposition characteristics would help further study of the floodplain effects on the peak of hyperconcentrated floods.},

  abstract =  {The separation of skin friction from total boundary layer shear stress for flows over bed forms is critical in erosion and sediment transport studies. Close-to-bed velocity profiles and skin friction shear velocities have been measured over mobile sand ripples of different geometries in a series of flume experiments to investigate the effects of form drag and flow stress partitioning. As expected, higher and longer ripples produce stronger form drag and hence higher total shear velocities for a given mean flow velocity, but the skin friction shear velocity was found to decrease with the increase in ripple height and length. For a fixed ripple geometry, the ratio of the skin friction to the total shear stress is also found to increase with the flow strength. Results of the present study together with data from previous investigations are used to test and extend the stress partition model of Smith and McLean (1977) for rippled beds. The Smith and McLean model is found to give reasonable partition of the skin friction from the total shear stress over mobile sand ripples. Overall empirical relationships based on total shear velocity and ripple geometry have also been obtained to understand the mechanisms of skin friction variation and to simplify the stress partitioning in bottom boundary layer flows over sand ripples.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to present a 2D depth-averaged model for simulating and examining flow patterns in channel bends. In particular, this paper proposes a 2D depth-averaged model that takes into account the influence of the secondary flow phenomenon through the calculation of the dispersion stresses arisen from the integration of the products of the discrepancy between the mean and the true velocity distributions. The proposed model uses an orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system to efficiently and accurately simulate the flow field with irregular boundaries. As for the numerical solution procedure, the two-step split-operator approach consisting of the dispersion step and the propagation step with the staggered grid is used to numerically solve the flow governing equations. Two sets of experimental data from de Vriend and Koch and from Rozovskii were used to demonstrate the model's capabilities. The former data set was from a mildly curved channel, whereas the latter was from a sharply curved channel. The simulations considering the secondary flow effect agree well with the measured data. Furthermore, an examination of the dispersion stress terms shows that the dispersion stresses play a major role in the transverse convection of the momentum shifting from the inner bank to the outer bank for flows in both mild and sharp bends.},

  abstract = {Abstract Alternate bars were formed by sediment transport in a flume with Froudeâ€�modelled flow and relative roughness characteristic of gravelâ€�boulder channels with steep slopes. The flume (0.3 m wide Ã— 7.5 m long) was filled with a sandâ€�gravel mixture, which was also fed into the top of the flume at a constant rate under constant discharge. Channel slope was set at 0.03. Initially, coarse particles accumulated on incipient bar heads near one side of the flume and diverted flow and bedload transport across the flume toward a pool scoured against the opposite flume wall downstream. Sorting in the pool directed coarse particles onto the next bar head downstream. Alternate sequences of pools and coarse bar heads were thereby linked down the entire flume by interactions of sediment sorting, flow, and channel morphology. During episodes of bar construction, unsorted bedload invaded interior bar surfaces and was deposited. Persistent deposition of coarse particles on bar heads prevented downstream migration of bars by inhibiting barâ€�head erosion and bedload transport over bars. Likely factors leading to barâ€�head stabilization in modelled gravelâ€�bed channels are coarse mixedâ€�size sediment, steep channel gradients, and shallow depths.},

  abstract = {The typical equation for bed level change in sediment transport in river, estuary and near shore systems is based on conservation of sediment mass. It is generally a nonlinear conservation equation for bed level. The physics here are similar to shallow water wave equations and gas dynamics equation which will develop shock waves in many circumstances. Many state-of-art morphological models use classical lower order Laxâ€“Wendroff or modified Laxâ€“Wendroff schemes for morphology which are not very stable for long time sediment transport processes simulation. Filtering or artificial diffusion are often added to achieve stability. In this paper, several shock capturing schemes are discussed for simulating bed level change with different accuracy and stability behaviors. The conclusion is in favor of a fifth order Euler-WENO scheme which is introduced to sediment transport simulations here over other schemes. The Euler-WENO scheme is shown to have significant advantages over schemes with artificial viscosity and filtering processes, hence is highly recommended especially for phase-resolving sediment transport models.},

If the upper fluid is thinner, the wave breaks backward. The speed of the various points of the wave does not vary monotonically with amplitude. If a shear exists, higher velocities in the upper layer in the direction of wave propagation favor the forward breaking of a wave. The opposite shear may cause a wave to break backward.},

  abstract = {Abstract Many models have been so far proposed to simulate and understand the long-term evolution of meandering rivers. Nevertheless, some modeling problems still need to be solved, for example, the physical soundness of long-term simulations when width variations are accounted for. The present work proposes the use of statistical tools to capture the spatiotemporal variations of channel width and to embed their effect into a physics-statistics-based model that simulates the river bank evolution. Erosion and deposition processes are assumed to act independently, with a specific shear stress threshold for each of them. In addition, the width evolution is linked with a river-specific probability density function. The analysis of a representative sample of meandering configurations, extracted from Landsat images, indicates that in many cases a generalized extreme value distribution nicely describes the along-channel distribution of cross-section width. For a given river, the parameters of this distribution keep almost constant in time. Significant variations are observed only after cutoff events that shorten the length of the river. The constraint of the river width based on the assumption of a generalized extreme value distribution ensures physically plausible configurations as the river moves throughout the floodplain, adapting continuously its local width. The application of the model to a reach of the Ucayali River appears to reasonably reproduce the planform river morphodynamics and yields realistic values of the cross-section widths.},

Solutions of these equations can be identified with trajectories in phase space. For those systems with bounded solutions, it is found that nonperiodic solutions are ordinarily unstable with respect to small modifications, so that slightly differing initial states can evolve into considerably different states. Systems with bounded solutions are shown to possess bounded numerical solutions. A simple system representing cellular convection is solved numerically. All of the solutions are found to be unstable, and almost all of them are nonperiodic. The feasibility of very-long-range weather prediction is examined in the light of these results.},

When one refines both space and time together, the convergence rate for a correct implementation will match that expected from an analysis of the asymptotic convergence rate (or local truncation error) of the method. Sometimes, however, only the time-step size is reduced, while the spatial mesh is held fixed. The observed rate of convergence in this case may then differ from the formal order of accuracy of the method in spaceâ€“time. In particular, one class of methods, second-order Laxâ€“Wendroff time-differencing, produces only first-order when the time step is refined at fixed spatial mesh resolution because the time and space differencing are intrinsically linked. Our method to arrive at this result is through analyzing the error at a defined point in time associated with many time steps. We demonstrate our results computationally.},

Modified flows include those in which a dense interstitial fluid, current, or escaping pure fluid aids in maintaining the dispersion. Conclusions regarding the dynamics of grain flows have been based largely on the analysis of Bagnold (1954) of fully confined, gravity-free dispersions. Natural flows are neither fully confined nor gravity-free, and their characteristics and dynamics differ significantly from his experimental systems. Velocity equations are developed and used to analyze natural grain flows. Unmodified subaerial and subaqueous, steady and uniform flows of sand occur only on slopes at or near the angle of repose, are generally less than 5 cm thick, and cannot individually account for the formation of thick sedimentation units. On slopes inclined at less than the angle of repose, grain flows collapse and freeze; on higher slopes, they accelerate, dilate, and become increasingly influenced by fluid forces. Thick grain flows of gravel-sized debris and thick flows modified by the presence of dense, plastic mud interstitial to the clasts (debris flows), polymodal coarse-sediment size distribution (density-modified grain flows), or concurrent sediment liquefaction or fluidization (liquefied or fluidized sediment flows) can move over relatively low slopes and accumulate as thick sedimentation units.},

  abstract = {Abstract An analytical modelling framework is proposed to reproduce the frequently observed but poorly studied occurrence of mid-channel bars in meandering channels. Mid-channel bars occur in meanders and may characterize transitional morphologies between pure meandering and braided rivers. Based on existing field and experimental observations, we propose that two different mechanisms can generate central topographical patterns in meanders. A former mechanism (â€˜width-forcedâ€™) is related to spatial width oscillations which determine a laterally symmetrical bed shear stress pattern that promotes mid-channel bars. A second mechanism (â€˜curvature-forcedâ€™) can take place also in curvilinear equiwidth streams since also longitudinal variations of channel curvature can produce laterally symmetrical alterations of the sediment transport capacity. A perturbation approach is employed to model both mechanisms within a common framework, allowing reproduction, at least qualitatively, of several observed features. While width-forced mid-channel bars are a symmetric linear altimetric response, to reproduce curvature-forced mid-channel bars requires modelling nonlinear flow-bed topography interactions at the second order of the perturbation expansion. Hypotheses on how these mechanisms operate are further discussed through an application to field cases. The amplitude of the nonlinear response can be relevant compared to that of the point bar in equiwidth meanders and the location of mid-channel bars seldom coincides with bend apexes, mainly depending upon the intrinsic meander wavelength. Central bars tend to symmetrically divert the flow against the two banks, a process which is proposed as a possible cause of cross-sectional overwidening, along with the asymmetry between the rates of bank erosion and of the opposite bank accretion. The outcomes of this first modelling step on the subject allow discussion of the mutual feedback processes that characterize interactions between mid-channel bars and width variations in river meanders.

  abstract  = {AbstractEquation systems describing one-dimensional, transient, two-phase flow with separate continuity, momentum, and energy equations for each phase are classified by use of the method of characteristics. The main purpose of this paper is to study the mathematical nature of these equations, not their physics, although it is realized that these two problems are not entirely independent. Many of the equation systems possess complex-valued characteristics and hence, according to well-known mathematical theorems, are not well-posed as initial-value problems (IVPs). Real-valued characteristics are necessary but not sufficient to ensure well-posedness. In the absence of lower order source or sink terms, that can affect the well-posedness of IVPs, the complex characteristics associated with these two-phase flow equations imply unbounded exponential growth for disturbances of all wavelengths.Analytical and numerical examples show that the ill posedness of IVPs for the two-phase flow partial differential equations that possess complex characteristics produce unstable numerical schemes. These unstable numerical schemes can produce apparently stable and even accurate results if the growth rate resulting from the complex characteristics remains small throughout the time span of the numerical experiment or if sufficient numerical damping is present for the increment size used. Other examples show that clearly nonphysical numerical instabilities resulting from the complex characteristics can be produced. These latter types of numerical instabilities are shown to be removed by the addition of physically motivated differential terms that eliminate the complex characteristics. These terms should not destroy long-wavelength physical instabilities that arise and that may sometimes be calculated approximately using ill-posed equation systems.},

Our theoretical framework, bolstered by field observations, demonstrates that the Huanghe tends toward upper-stage plane bed, yielding minimal form drag, thus markedly enhancing sediment transport efficiency. We present a sediment transport formulation applicable to all river systems with silt to coarse-sand beds. This formulation demonstrates a remarkably sensitive dependence on grain size within a certain narrow range and therefore has special relevance to silt-sand fluvial systems, particularly those affected by dams.},

  abstract  = {Grade is a condition of equilibrium in streams as agents of transportation. The validity of the concept has been questioned, but it is indispensable in any genetic study of fluvial erosional features and deposits. This paper modifies and extends the theory of grade originally set forth by Gilbert and Davis.A graded stream is one in which, over a period of years, slope is delicately adjusted to provide, with available discharge and the prevailing channel characteristics, just the velocity required for transportation of all of the load supplied from above. Slope usually decreases in a downvalley direction, but because discharge, channel characteristics, and load do not vary systematically along the stream, the graded profile is not a simple mathematical curve. Corrasive power and bed rock resistance to corrasion determine the slope of the ungraded profile, but have no direct influence on the graded profile. Chiefly because of a difference in rate of downvalley decrease in caliber of load, the aggrading profile differs in form from the graded profile; the aggrading profile is, and the graded profile is not, asymptotic with respect to a horizontal line passing through base level. It is critical in any analysis of stream profiles to recognize the difference in slope-controlling factors in parts of the overall profile that are (1) graded, (2) ungraded, and (3) aggrading.A graded stream responds to a change in conditions in accordance with Le Chatelier's general law:!!e!!if a stress is brought to bear on a system in equilibrium, a reaction occurs, displacing the equilibrium in a direction that tends to absorb the effect of the stress.!!e!!? Readjustment is effected primarily by appropriate modification of slope by upbuilding or downcutting, and only to a minor extent or not at all by concomitant changes in channel characteristics. Paired examples illustrate (1) the almost telegraphic rapidity with which the first phases of the reaction of a graded stream to a number of artificial changes are propagated upvalley and downvalley and, (2) the more or less complete readjustment that is effected over a period of thousands of years to analogous natural changes.The engineer is necessarily concerned chiefly with short-term and quantitative aspects of the reaction of a graded stream to changes in control, while the attention of the geologist is usually focused on the long-term and genetic aspects of the stream's response to changes. But the basic problems are the same, and a pooling of ideas and data may enable the engineer to improve his long range planning of river control measures and permit the geologist to interpret, in quantitative terms, the deposits of ancient streams.},

  abstract = {Geological processes such as erosion and sedimentation redistribute toxic pollutants introduced to the landscape by mining, agriculture, weapons development, and other human activities. A significant portion of these contaminants is insoluble, adsorbing to soils and sediments after being released. Geologists have long understood that much of this sediment is stored in river floodplains, which are increasingly recognized as important nonpoint sources of pollution in rivers. However, the fate of contaminated sediment has generally been analyzed using hydrodynamic models of in-channel processes, ignoring particle exchange with the floodplain. Here, we present a stochastic theory of sediment redistribution in alluvial valley floors that tracks particle-bound pollutants and explicitly considers sediment storage within floodplains. We use the theory to model the future redistribution and radioactive decay of 137Cs currently stored on sediment in floodplains at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in New Mexico. Model results indicate that floodplain storage significantly reduces the rate of sediment delivery from upper Los Alamos Canyon, allowing 50\% of the 137Cs currently residing in the valley floor to decay radioactively before leaving LANL. A sensitivity analysis shows that the rate of sediment overturn in the valley (and hence, the total amount of radioactive 137Cs predicted to leave LANL) is significantly controlled by the rate of sediment exchange with the floodplain. Our results emphasize that floodplain sedimentation and erosion processes can strongly influence the redistribution of anthropogenic pollutants in fluvial environments. We introduce a new theoretical framework for examining this interaction, which can provide a scientific basis for decision-making in a wide range of river basin management scenarios.},

  abstract = {Abstract Temporary storage of sediment within alluvial valley floors modulates the longâ€�term transport of sediment through landscapes. The fate of weathering minerals or sedimentâ€�bound constituents in fluvial environments depends on the relative time scales of constituent degradation and particle residence time within valleys. Particles follow a set of trajectories through valley floors: some particles pass directly through the channel, reaching the basin outlet rapidly after being introduced to the fluvial system; others remain for long periods in deposits such as flood plains. Traditional sediment routing theory, based on the principle of sediment mass conservation along reaches of channel, does not account for exchanges of sediment with temporary sediment storage reservoirs outside the channel, such as flood plains, deltas, and alluvial fans. This article formalizes a theory that incorporates the role of such exchanges in the migration of sediment through river systems, by computing the probabilistic structure of particle trajectories through alluvial valley floors. Equations are developed for computing these trajectories from the sediment budget of a valley floor in steady state. Mathematical strategies for using such relationships to model transient storage conditions are proposed, and other potential model enhancements are discussed. The approach is illustrated using a hypothetical valley floor as an example. The theory can be used to examine rates of sediment overturn in valleys, map particle residence times, and account for the redistribution and decomposition of weathering minerals and particleâ€�bound constituents. The theory has numerous potential management applications, some of which are discussed herein. The hypothetical example demonstrates that the probability distribution of particle residence times in the valleys of most alluvial rivers should be strongly right skewed.},

  abstract  = {Fundamental to interpreting the stratigraphic architecture within a basin is understanding the relationship between a basin!!e!!s external conditions and its stratigraphic response. Here we present a model of fluvial basin filling that is based on two field observations. Firstly, natural fluvial systems commonly have an upstream region dominated by gravel transport and a downstream region dominated by sand transport with the transition between the two being relatively abrupt. Second, gravel bed and sand bed systems operate at nearly constant but different mean Shields stresses. Our model is based on a single, linear diffusion equation but is unique in that we use distinct transport (diffusion) coefficients for the two dominant fluvial regimes: a proximal gravel region and a distal sand region. This problem is complicated by the existence of two moving boundaries: the position of the distal fluvial toe and the position of the gravel!!e!!sand transition. We present a rigorous numerical treatment of both of these moving boundaries and verify our numerical formulation by comparing the model results to a semi-analytical solution technique.We use the model to examine the stratigraphic response to perturbations in four external boundary conditions: sediment supply, water supply, rate of subsidence and gravel fraction. The response is analysed in terms of the phase relation between forcing and the position of the gravel front, the position of the fluvial toe, proximal accumulation rate and distal accumulation rate. The model supports the results of earlier single-diffusion models suggesting that the form of the response is dependent on the period of the perturbation relative to the intrinsic basin response time. For forcing periods less than the intrinsic basin response time, basin response is nearly constant and independent of the forcing period, suggesting that the transport system controls basin response. For forcing periods greater than the intrinsic response time of the basin the response time of the basin increases directly with the forcing period, suggesting that the transport system plays no role in limiting basin response. For gravel!!e!!sand systems we show that the intrinsic response time is a function of the ratio of gravel to sand entering the basin. Forcing of the above external boundaries, both slowly and rapidly relative to the basin response time, produces both distal and proximal unconformities. We present a nondimensional !!e!!unconformity number!!e!! that constrains the amplitude and period of forcing necessary to generate proximal unconformities.},

  abstract  = {Understanding channel bifurcation mechanics is of great importance for predicting and managing multichannel river processes and avulsion in distributary river deltas. To date, research on river channel bifurcations has focused on factors determining the stability and evolution of bifurcations. It has recently been shown that, theoretically, the nonlinearity of the relation between sediment transport and flow discharge causes one of the two distributaries of a (slightly) asymmetrical bifurcation to grow and the other to shrink. The positive feedback introduced by this effect results in highly asymmetrical bifurcations. However, there is a lack of detailed insight into flow dynamics within river bifurcations, the consequent effect on bed load flux through bifurcating channels, and thus the impact on bifurcation stability over time. In this paper, three key parameters (discharge ratio, width-to-depth ratio, and bed roughness) were varied in order to examine the secondary flow field and its effect on flow partitioning, particularly near-bed and surface flow, at an experimental bifurcation. Discharge ratio was controlled by varying downstream water levels. Flow fields were quantified using both particle image velocimetry and ultrasonic Doppler velocity profiling. Results show that a bifurcation induces secondary flow cells upstream of the bifurcation. In the case of unequal discharge ratio, a strong increase in the secondary flow near the bed causes a larger volume of near-bed flow to enter the dominant channel compared to surface and depth-averaged flow. However, this effect diminishes with larger width-to-depth ratio and with increased bed roughness. The flow structure and division pattern will likely have a stabilizing effect on river channel bifurcations. The magnitude of this effect in relation to previously identified destabilizing effects is addressed by proposing an adjustment to a widely used empirical bed load nodal-point partition equation. Our finding implies that river bifurcations can be stable under a wider range of conditions than previously thought.},

Nikora et al. (2002) hypothesized that particle motion at short time scales is superdiffusive because of inertia, while long-time subdiffusion results from heavy-tailed rest durations between particle motions. Here we test this hypothesis with laboratory experiments that trace the motion of individual gravels under near-threshold intermittent bed load transport (0.027 < !!e!!* < 0.087). Particle behavior consists of two independent states: a mobile phase, in which indeed we find superdiffusive behavior, and an immobile phase, in which gravels distrained from the fluid remain stationary for long durations. Correlated grain motion can account for some but not all of the superdiffusive behavior for the mobile phase; invoking heterogeneity of grain size provides a plausible explanation for the rest. Grains that become immobile appear to stay at rest until the bed scours down to an elevation that exposes them to the flow. The return time distribution for bed scour is similar to the distribution of rest durations, and both have power law tails. Results provide a physical basis for scaling regimes of anomalous dispersion and the time scales that separate these regimes.},

  abstract = {AbstractSediment tracers are increasingly employed to estimate bed load transport and landscape evolution rates. Tracer trajectories are dominated by periods of immobility (â€œwaiting timesâ€�) as they are buried and reexcavated in the stochastically evolving river bed. Here we model bed evolution as a random walk with mean-reverting tendency (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process) originating from the restoring effect of erosion and deposition. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model contains two parameters, a and b, related to the particle feed rate and range of bed elevation fluctuations, respectively. Observations of bed evolution in flume experiments agree with model predictions; in particular, the model reproduces the asymptotic tâˆ’1 tail in the tracer waiting time exceedance probability distribution. This waiting time distribution is similar to that inferred for tracers in natural gravel streams and avalanching rice piles, indicating applicability of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reverting model to many disordered transport systems with tracer burial and excavation.},

  abstract = {Abstract Aggradation, progradation and retrogradation are the main patterns that define the large-scale architecture of Gilbert-type deltas. These patterns are governed by the ratio between the variation in accommodation space and sediment supply experienced during delta growth. Sediment supply variations are difficult to estimate in ancient settings; hence, it is rarely possible to assess its significance in the large-scale stratigraphic architecture of Gilbert-type deltas. This paper presents a stratigraphic analysis of a Pliocene deltaic complex composed of two coeval and narrowly spaced deltaic branches. The two branches recorded the same tectonic- and climate-induced accommodation space variations. As a result, this deltaic complex represents a natural laboratory for testing the effects of sediment supply variations on the stratigraphic architecture of Gilbert-type deltas. The field data suggest that a sediment supply which is able to counteract the accommodation generated over time promotes the aggradational/progradational attitude of Gilbert-type deltas, as well as the development of thick foreset deposits. By contrast, if the sediment supply is not sufficient for counterbalancing the generated accommodation, an aggradational/retrogradational stratigraphic architecture is promoted. In this case, the deltaic system is forced to withdraw during the different phases of generation of accommodation, with the subsequent flooding of previously deposited sub-horizontal topset deposits (i.e., the delta plain). The subsequent deltaic progradation occurs above these deposits and, consequently, the available space for foresets growth is limited to the water depth between the base-level and the older delta plain. This leads to the vertical stacking of relatively thin deltaic deposits with an overall aggradatational/retrogradational attitude.},

  abstract = {Abstract Historical information on river degradation was used in a case study on the GÃ¡llego River, a tributary of the Ebro River, in northeastern Spain. The GÃ¡llego drains about 4000km2 of the southern slopes of the Pyrenees. Good channel surveys since the 1940s allowed a comparison of longitudinal bed profiles over time. Over this period about 1million m3 of gravel was mined according to the archival records. The volume of alluvium lost due to incision in the same period was 2million m3. This imbalance is tentatively explained by a budget model based on a bedload equation and an algorithm to determine whether the effective bedload transport is controlled by the transport capacity or by the supply of sediment. It appears that the incision process has changed the magnitude of the shear stresses on channel bed. As the river became deeper, the channel could accommodate higher discharges without overbank flooding. The results obtained from a second model based on diffusion equation for the bed elevation compared well with the field data. This model is based on the hypotheses of steady uniform flow regarding water and sediment conservation.},

  abstract = {Subsidence is a common cause of amplified relative sea-level rise, flooding, and erosion in coastal environments. In particular, subsidence due to sediment consolidation can play a significant role in relative sea-level rise in large deltas. We use a combination of InSAR (interferometric synthetic aperture radar), leveling, and global positioning system data to map absolute vertical land motion in the Fraser River delta, western Canada. We show that primary consolidation of shallow Holocene sediments is the main cause for the slow subsidence (!!e!!1 to !!e!!2 mm/a) affecting the delta lowlands. In addition, parts of the delta undergo increased anthropogenic subsidence. Rapid subsidence rates (!!e!!3 to !!e!!8 mm/a) are associated with recent artificial loads and exhibit a first-order exponential decrease with a time constant of ~20 years, consistent with the theory of consolidation. Assuming two sea-level rise scenarios of 30 or 100 cm by the end of the twenty-first century, natural subsidence will augment relative sea-level rise in the Fraser Holocene lowlands by ~50% or ~15%. Anthropogenic subsidence will augment relative sea-level rise by ~130% or ~40%, potentially raising it to as much as 1!!e!!2 m. In deltaic, lacustrine, and alluvial environments, anthropogenic sediment consolidation can result in significant amplification and strong spatial variations of relative sea-level rise that need to be considered in local planning.},

Annual total suspended loads at three stations are virtually identical, averaging 17 !!e!! 106 tonnes/year (t yr!!e!!1). The suspended sand load is about 5.5 !!e!! 106 t yr!!e!!1, about one third of the total. In the gravel bed reach of the river the sand behaves as wash load. Significant transport of gravel begins at Agassiz at a discharge of about 5000 m3 s!!e!!1. The annual gravel transport was estimated to be about 0.23 !!e!! 106 t yr!!e!!1, only 1% of the total load. All of this material is deposited in the reach upstream of Mission. At Mission, sands finer than 0.177 mm make up more than 50% of the suspended sand load but are virtually absent from the sand bed. Therefore a portion of the sand load at Mission is wash load. The total bed material load here was estimated to be 3.0 !!e!! 106 t yr!!e!!1, about 18% of the total sediment load. Virtually all of the bed material load was transported in intermittent suspension near the bed, less than 5% occurring as bed load. In the long term the suspended sand load upstream is approximately equal to the total sand load at Mission. However, within individual years some of the sand is stored within the reach temporarily and then reentrained later.},

Such information can be used to assess numerous properties of particle transport that are beyond the capabilities of conventional tracking methods. Conclusions include: (i) rocks are more likely to move on rising hydrograph limbs than on falling hydrograph limbs; (ii) the average Shields' parameter is 0Â·046; (iii) rocks move only a fraction of the time between initial and final motion during an event; (iv) the distributions of motion and rest periods are best modeled by gamma functions rather than exponential, but the distributions approach exponential as the tails are trimmed.

Further, we are able to extend the methods used for showing the existence of an infinite period bifurcation to calculate the amplitude of the limit cycle over its whole range of existence. These ideas are then applied to an equation arising in the theory of roll waves down an open inclined channel, extending previous work to include the case when the Reynolds number is large with the Froude number close to its critical value for the temporal instability of the uniform flow. Here the governing equation reduces to one similar in form to the model equation.},

Other factors controlling sediment discharge (e.g., climate, runoff) appear to have secondary importance. A notable exception is the influence of human activity, climate, and geology on the rivers draining southern Asia and Oceania. Sediment fluxes from small mountainous rivers, many of which discharge directly onto active margins (e.g., western South and North America and most high-standing oceanic islands), have been greatly underestimated in previous global sediment budgets, perhaps by as much as a factor of three. In contrast, sediment fluxes to the ocean from large rivers (nearly all of which discharge onto passive margins or marginal seas) have been overestimated, as some of the sediment load is subaerially sequestered in subsiding deltas. Before the proliferation of dam construction in the latter half of this century, rivers probably discharged about 20 billion tons of sediment annually to the ocean. Prior to widespread farming and deforestation (beginning 2000-2500 yr ago), however, sediment discharge probably was less than half the present level. Sediments discharged by small mountainous rivers are more likely to escape to the deep sea during high stands of sea level by virtue of a greater impact of episodic events (i.e., flash floods and earthquakes) on small drainage basins and because of the narrow shelves associated with active margins. The resulting delta/fan deposits can be distinctly different than the sedimentary deposits derived from larger rivers that discharge onto passive margins.},

  abstract  = {For the conservation and restoration of river environment, a sediment replenishment technique, which conveys a part of the sediments excavated and/or dredged from reservoirs to the river below dams is developed and has been implemented tentatively in several dams. Sediments placed as replenishment can be flushed out and transported downstream by floodwater or dam releases. The flushed sediments are expected to contribute to the control of degradation and the variation of the low-flow channel. However, this technique is in the development stage because there are many unknown factors. Therefore, systematic investigations are necessary for practical management of the technique. In this study, the effects of the location of replenishment sediment on sediment flushing and on control of degradation were investigated by means of flume experiments. A two-dimensional numerical model was also developed to further investigate the effects of sediment augmentation on river restoration. The numerical model treats bank erosion and sediment transport over fixed beds. The simulation results were verified against the experimental results. The flushing process of replenishment sediment was investigated first, and then its effect as a countermeasure for river bed degradation was analyzed. Results are summarized as follows: (1) Augmentation at upper riffles is effective for flushing of replenishment sediment and variation of low-flow channel. (2) Amelioration of degradation can be found in the cases of two types of placement. The amelioration effect of upper riffle placement was larger than that of lower riffle placement (3) Aggradation rate of the bed near the replenishment site in the fixed bed is large in the lower riffle placement compared with the upper riffle placement. (4) The numerical model was found to be generally successful as a predictive tool.},

  abstract = {Abstract?Accumulation rates of terrestrial sediment have increased in the past few million years both on and adjacent to continents, although not everywhere. Apparently, erosion has increased in elevated terrain regardless of when last tectonically active or what the present-day climate. In many regions, sediment coarsened abruptly in late Pliocene time. Sparser data suggest increased sedimentation rates at 15 Ma, approximately when oxygen isotopes in benthic foraminifera imply high-latitude cooling. If climate change effected accelerated erosion, understanding how it did so remains the challenge. Some obvious candidates, such as lowered sea level leading to erosion of continental shelves or increased glaciation, account for increased sedimentation in some, but not all, areas. Perhaps stable climates that varied slowly allowed geomorphic processes to maintain a state of equilibrium with little erosion until 3�4 Ma, when large oscillations in climate with periods of 20,000�40,000 years developed and denied the landscape the chance to reach equilibrium.},

  abstract  = {Theoretical analysis of mathematical equations is complementary to numerical solution as it offers additional insights into the fundamental behaviour of the corresponding physical system. An example is the theory of overdeepening in river morphodynamics. This theory explains why outer-bend pools can be locally deeper than the equilibrium outer-bend water depth in infinitely long river bends. Its essence lies in the superimposition of a steady alternate bar pattern on a streamwise uniform river bed topography. The same steady alternate bar pattern arises in a straight channel in response to a local permanent geometrical disturbance. Basically, the overdeepening theory describes river bed topography by a double-periodic function with an amplitude decaying exponentially along the river. This function yields two problems of interpretation. First, certain parameter combinations produce a growing rather than a decaying amplitude. Which phenomena are related to this situation? Originally, the growing amplitudes were explained as an indication of incipient braiding, but this interpretation was soon discarded because growing bed deformations in a linear theory may still reach a finite amplitude by nonlinear effects. The second problem of interpretation was whether the double-periodic function holds upstream or downstream of the local disturbance, or both. Originally it was assumed to hold only downstream, because of the very short adaptation length of the upstream flow accelerating towards a local constriction. Later upstream influence was revealed to occur as well, albeit with initially differing opinions on the corresponding parameter ranges. We review the history of the shifting interpretations of the overdeepening theory. In this way we seek to demonstrate that mathematical analyses of physical systems do not produce straightforward answers or predictions, but inherently require interpretations based on experimental evidence and a thorough understanding of the underlying physical processes.},

  abstract =  {The morphological response of the Dutch Rhine branches to interventions depends sensitively on the morphological development of the bifurcations. Computations in the 1990s revealed that proper modelling of this morphological development requires the inclusion of physical mechanisms for grain sorting. Therefore we apply a two-dimensional (2D) morphological Delft3D model with graded sediment to the Rhine bifurcation at Pannerden (â€œPannerdensche Kopâ€�). We find that such a computation, unlike computations with uniform sediment, hardly produces any changes in bed topography at a discharge of 2400m3/s. Only a less frequent flood discharge of 6000m3/s is found to produce topography changes. Apparently, the highest floods need to be included when modelling the combined evolution of bed topography and bed sediment composition. We explain this from the time scales for bed topography development and the development of bed sediment composition. If the composition pattern develops fast with respect to bed topography, the sediment is rearranged immediately in a way that eliminates the gradients in sediment transport capacity, after which the bed topography remains unchanged. We show theoretically that the ratio of transport layer thickness to flow depth is the key parameter that determines the ratio of these time scales. The findings also suggest that existing theories tend to underestimate the thickness of the transport layer, with the important implication that computational results may give the false idea of a stable bed topography in cases where the real topography is not stable at all.},

As a consequence, morphodynamic models are increasingly developed, used and evaluated by non-experts, possibly leading to mistakes. This paper draws attention to five types of common mistakes. First, new morphodynamic codes are developed as extensions of existing hydrodynamic codes without including all essential physical processes. Second, model inputs are specified in a way that imposes morphodynamic patterns beforehand rather than letting them evolve freely. Third, detailed processes are parameterized inadequately for application to larger spatial and temporal scales. Fourth, physical and numerical phenomena are confused when interpreting model results. Fifth, the selection of modeling approaches is driven by the belief that complete data are a prerequisite for modeling and that the application of 2D and 3D models requires more data than the application of 1D models. Examples from fluvial morphodynamics are presented to illustrate these mistakes.},

This study reviews differences in the required accuracy of model results and differences in the choice between physical and numerical modelling. Physical models are used for studying elementary processes and their interactions under controlled conditions in scientific research; for the planning and design of interventions in hydraulic engineering; and for explanation and demonstration in public decision-making. Numerical models are powerful tools in scientific research, but field applications cannot be verified or validated according to rigorous scientific standards. Hydraulic engineers use numerical models for various purposes, some requiring a high accuracy and some not. They are used to uncertainty and deal with this by means of sensitivity analyses or probabilistic approaches. Numerical models are also used for decision-making on interventions that affect stakeholders, sometimes even having the last word in corresponding protocols or legislation. The suggested or perceived accuracy of model results is in this context much higher than the real accuracy. This leads to the paradoxical situation that decision makers and stakeholders put higher demands on accuracy than scientists do.},

These systems can be studied as a particular case of nonconservative hyperbolic systems [3, 4, 5]. The theory developed by Dal Maso, LeFloch and Murat [2] is used to define a concept of weak solutions of nonconservative systems based on the choice of a family of paths in the phase space. The notion of path-conservative numerical scheme introduced in [6], which generalizes that of conservative scheme for conservative systems, is also related to the choice of a family of paths. In this work we present an appropriate choice of paths in order to define the concept of weak solution (see [1, 8]) in the particular case of balance laws, together with the notion of path-conservative numerical scheme for this particular case and some properties. We also consider the well-balance property of these schemes and the consistency with the definition of weak solutions, with a result pointing in the direction of a Lax-Wendroff type convergence result.},

  abstract =  {The available information on the river characteristics of the Meuse River in combination with the  geological conditions are assessed and analyzed in an attempt to understand the occurrence of a transition from a  gravel-bed to a sand-bed river. This transition is characterized by a reduction inD50 of the bed material from about  16 to about 2.6mm whilst the bed slope changes from about 0.5 to 0.10 m/km. From the analysis it is concluded  that neotectonic subsidence provides an adequate environment for deposition of coarser sediments triggering the  selective transport of particles.The combined action of this selective transport and the abrasion of sediment particles  result in an increase of the sand content on the bed material. After some distance a threshold point is reached  where the sand content starts to govern the behavior of the sediment mixture; at this point the sand overwhelms  the gravel and the river starts to behave as a sand-bed river; consequently the gravel-sand transition is formed.},

  abstract = {Numerical models can be useful for explaining poorly understood phenomena or for reliable quantitative predictions. When modeling a multi-scale system, a �top-down� approach�basing models on emergent variables and interactions, rather than explicitly on the much faster and smaller scale processes that give rise to them�facilitates both goals. Parameterizations representing emergent interactions range from highly simplified and abstracted to more quantitatively accurate. Empirically based large-scale parameterizations lead more reliably to accurate large-scale behavior than do parameterizations of much smaller scale processes. Conversely, purposefully simplified representations of model interactions can enhance a model's utility for explanation, clarifying the key feedbacks leading to an enigmatic behavior. For such potential insights to be relevant, the interactions in the model need to correspond to those in the �real� system in some straightforward way. Such a correspondence usually holds for models constructed for predictive purposes, although this is not a requirement. The goals motivating a modeling endeavor help determine the most appropriate modeling strategies, as well as the most appropriate criteria for judging model usefulness.},

Such models can be difficult to test quantitatively because the statistics traditionally used can be insensitive even to visually obvious variations in a complex pattern. Here we develop a new approach to evaluating such models. We begin by applying to spatial patterns the stateâ€�space reconstruction techniques developed for dynamical systems, producing plots that summarize the patterns in a way that preserves more information than do the statistics usually used in geomorphology. Methods exist for characterizing some aspects of such plots. Here we develop a complementary method for quantitatively comparing stateâ€�space plots in a way that more directly evaluates the similarity between the typical features of spatial patterns. An application of this method to the patterns produced by a cellular braidedâ€�stream model and real braided streams indicates that this approach provides a relatively sensitive way of comparing modelâ€�generated and real spatial patterns.},

  abstract  = {We have shown in a previous paper that many of the main features of braided streams can be captured in a relatively simple cellular computer model. Here we examine some of the detailed characteristics of this model. We show the qualitative form of the braiding produced by the model is generally insensitive to changes in most of the numerical parameters used in the model. The most crucial parameter choice is the use of a non-linear exponent (>1) to describe the relation between sediment flux and local stream power. Use of water discharge instead of stream power to parameterize sediment flux produces braiding, but also unrealistically high-amplitude topography variations in the long term. Introduction of a threshold transport condition causes no noticeable change in the model's behaviour. Inclusion of lateral sediment transport due to gravitational effects on lateral slopes is not crucial to produce braiding, but is needed to provide reasonable lateral channel shifting, and to maintain a continuing dynamic behaviour. As long as lateral sediment transport is included, altering the initial topography for a run has no effect, other than a transient period of regrading. In addition, we show that there is a simple and apparently fundamental connection between braided-stream channel networks and erosional (dendritic) networks that has not been previously recognized. All that is needed to switch the model from braided to dendritic patterns is either to remove redeposition from the rules, simulating entrainment of cohesive sediment, or to add a cliff to the initial topography, making local redeposition unimportant. This result suggests that the presence or absence of significant local redeposition, which causes bar formation, channel division, and avulsion, determines whether a braided or dendritic pattern will form.

  abstract  = {Autostratigraphy is the stratigraphy generated by large-scale autogenic processes, and needs to be heeded because of a current overreliance on allogenic controls in sequence stratigraphy. Key principles of autostratigraphy, emerging from the theory of autoretreat and a new understanding of alluvial grade, derive from the non-equilibrium stratigraphic response, i.e., the general lack of equilibrium configuration of depositional systems. The non-equilibrium behavior of fluvial deltas during times (T) of steady dynamic forcing leads to variable stratigraphic response that is the inevitable result of length (D) and time (!!e!!) scaling particular to the depositional system, rather than necessarily reflecting any sudden or unsteady change in the rate of allogenic forcing. Some abrupt breaks in the stratigraphic record are not necessarily associated with changes in allogenic conditions but can result from purely autogenic processes of the system. When T is comparable to or longer than !!e!!, (1) the depositional system takes the non-equilibrium, large-scale autogenic response, (2) the superposition of autogenic and allogenic components of the forcing is prominently nonlinear, and thus (3) sequence stratigraphic models that have been built on the assumption of equilibrium response are incorrect. Autostratigraphic analysis makes it possible to detect and identify complex autogenic responses and unsteady allogenic events in the stratigraphic record by quantifying a temporal change in the magnitude of D. Autostratigraphy thus functions as a "norm" for genetic stratigraphy.},

It may thus not be necessary to invoke any change in tectonic and/or paleoclimatic factors to explain the retreat phases of deltas recognized in the stratigraphic record.

The generally accepted notion, here referred to as the A/S ratio concept, stating that the migration of a shoreline is controlled principally by the magnitude of the ratio of A to S is insufficient and somewhat misleading, partly owing to the problem of dimensional confusion. The interplay of A and S inevitably results in autoretreat of the shoreline, whereby the seaward advance of any shoreline is halted and is subsequently turned to landward retreat, provided there is a continuous rise of relative sea level. How effective the autoretreat process is depends, for a given period of relative sea level rising, upon the length of potential time period for the seaward advance of shoreline, and is proportional to A 2 / S and A (super 1.5) / S (super 0.5) in two- and three-dimensional sediment dispersal modes, respectively. Autoretreat becomes more effective as A increases and/or S decreases: A functions more critically to the effectiveness than S does. The A/S ratio concept is only approximately applicable when autoretreat is less effective (i.e., with very low A and/or very high S ). In this sense, the autoretreat theory and the A/S ratio concept are complementary to each other. The autoretreat mechanism is expected to be substantially useful not only in fluvial deltas but also in many other depositional systems (e.g., barrier islands) whose evolution has been considered in terms of the A/S ratio concept.},

This is achieved by using a multilevel Cartesian grid technique that allows the grid to be refined in high-gradient regions and in the vicinity of the river bed. The grid can be locally refined and adapted to the bed geometry, managing the Cartesian grid cells and faces using a hierarchical tree data approach. A ghost-cell immersed-boundary technique is applied to cells intersecting the bed topography. The governing equations have been discretized using a finite-volume method on a staggered grid, conserving second-order accuracy in time and space. The solution advances in time using the fractional step approach. Large-eddy simulation is used as turbulence closure. We validate the model against several experiments and other results from literature. Model results for Stokes flow around a cylinder in the vicinity of a moving wall agree well with Wannier's analytical solution. At higher Reynolds numbers, computed trailing bubble length, separation angle, and drag coefficient compare favorably with experimental and previous computational results. Results for the flow over two- and three-dimensional dunes agree well with published data, including a fair reproduction of recirculation zones, horse-shoe structures, and boiling effects. This shows that the model is suitable for being used as a hydrodynamic submodel in the high-resolution modeling of sediment transport and formation and evolution of subaqueous ripples and dunes.},

This sediment model consists of four submodels: pickup, transport over the bed, transport in the water column and deposition, all based on a turbulent flow model using large-eddy simulation. The sediment is considered as uniform rigid spherical particles. This is usually a valid assumption for sand-bed rivers where underwater dune formation is most prominent. Under certain shear stress conditions, these particles are picked up from the bed due to an imbalance of gravity and flow forces. They either roll and slide on the bed in a sheet of sediment or separate from the bed and get suspended in the flow. Sooner or later, the suspended particles settle on the bed again. Each of these steps is modeled separately, yielding a physics-based process model for sediment transport, suitable for the simulation of bed morphodynamics. The sediment model is validated with theoretical findings such as the Rouse profile as well as with empirical relations of sediment bed load and suspended load transport. The current model shows good agreement with these theoretical and empirical relations. Moreover, the saltation mechanism is simulated, and the average saltation length, height, and velocity are found to be in good agreement with experimental results.},

The flow is modeled by large eddy simulation on a Cartesian grid with local refinements. The sediment transport is modeled by computing pickup, transport over the bed, transport in the water column, and deposition of rigid spherical particles in a Lagrangian framework. The morphological development of the bed is modeled by a sediment balance equation in which the pickup and deposition from the sediment motion submodels appear as source and sink terms. The model realistically replicated the formation and migration of dunes. Model results showed a good agreement with data from five flume experiments. We subsequently applied the model to investigate the effect of sediment grain size on ripples. Finer sediments were found to yield more superimposed ripples than coarser sediments. Moreover, under the same hydrodynamic conditions, the finer sediments yielded two-dimensional bed forms, whereas for coarser sediment irregularities increased. We extended the tests to pronounced 3-D morphologies by simulating the development of local scour at a pier. The results agreed well with experimental data. The model contributes to unraveling the complex problem of small-scale morphodynamics and may be used in a wide range of applications, for instance, to develop more reliable parameterizations of small-scale processes for application in large-scale morphodynamic models.},

  abstract = {AbstractDunes dominate the bed of sand rivers and are of central importance in predicting flow roughness and water levels. The present study has focused on the details of flow and sediment dynamics along migrating sand dunes in equilibrium. Using a recently developed acoustic system (Acoustic Concentration and Velocity Profiler), new insights are obtained in the behavior of the bed and the suspended load transport along mobile dunes. Our data have illustrated that, due to the presence of a dense sediment layer close to the bed and migrating secondary bedforms over the stoss side of the dune toward the dune crest, the near-bed flow and sediment processes are significantly different from the near-bed flow and sediment dynamics measured over fixed dunes. It was observed that the shape of the total sediment transport distribution along dunes is mainly dominated by the bed load transport, although the bed load and the suspended load transport are of the same order of magnitude. This means that it was especially the bed load transport that is responsible for the continuous erosion and deposition of sediment along the migrating dunes. Whereas the bed load is entirely captured in the dune with zero transport at the flow reattachment point, a significant part of the suspended load is advected to the downstream dune depending on the flow conditions. For the two flow conditions measured, the bypass fraction was about 10\% for flow with a Froude number (Fr) of 0.41 and 27\% for flow with Froude number of 0.51. This means that respectively 90\% (for the Frâ€‰=â€‰0.41 flow) and 73\% (for the Frâ€‰=â€‰0.51 flow) of the total sediment load that arrived at the dune crests contributed to the migration of the dunes.},

  abstract  = {Large asymmetric bedforms known as dunes commonly dominate the bed of sand rivers. Due to the turbulence generation over their stoss and lee sides, dunes are of central importance in predicting hydraulic roughness and water levels. During floods in steep alluvial rivers, dunes are observed to grow rapidly as flow strength increases, undergoing an unstable transition regime, after which they are washed out in what is called upper stage plane bed. This transition of dunes to upper stage plane bed is associated with high transport of bed sediment in suspension and large decrease in bedform roughness. In the present study, we aim to improve the prediction of dune development and dune transition to upper stage plane bed by introducing the transport of suspended sediment in an existing dune evolution model. In addition, flume experiments are carried out to investigate dune development under bed load and suspended load dominated transport regimes, and to get insight in the time scales related to the transition of dunes to upper stage plane bed. Simulations with the extended model including the transport of suspended sediment show significant improvement in the prediction of equilibrium dune parameters (e.g. dune height, dune length, dune steepness, dune migration rate, dune lee side slope) both under bed load dominant and suspended load dominant transport regimes. The chosen modeling approach also allows us to model the transition of dunes to upper stage plane bed which was not possible with the original dune evolution model. The extended model predicts change in the dune shapes as was observed in the flume experiments with decreasing dune heights and dune lee slopes. Furthermore, the time scale of dune transition to upper stage plane bed was quite well predicted by the extended model. Copyright !!e!! 2015 John Wiley  \&  Sons, Ltd.},

A suitable mathematical description of the system is based on the energy balance equation for general flow processes yielding a system of coupled hyperbolic partial differential equations in two dimensions. System responses to perturbations of inlet temperatures and mass flow rates are numerically calculated with an explicit finite difference method. A criterion for the generation of computational grids minimising effects of numerical dispersion and dissipation is applied to the system of coupled pure cross-flow heat exchangers which has not been considered up to now. Due to its internal circulation the coupled system shows a different behaviour compared to single cross-flow heat exchangers like inverse response and oscillatory behaviour to non-oscillating input signals.},

  abstract  = {The long-term effectiveness of a geomorphic event of a particular magnitude is the product of the effect of a single event of that magnitude times the frequency with which it recurs (magnitude-frequency analysis). If discharge frequency of a stream is assumed to be log-normally distributed and if sediment transport rate is assumed to be a power function of discharge, then transport effectiveness attains a maximum value at some discharge, termed here the "effective discharge," that moves the most sediment over the long term. The effective discharge and its recurrence interval may be predicted if both assumptions are correct. Analysis of 55 U.S. streams demonstrates that the observed and the predicted recurrence intervals of the effective discharge are in poor agreement. This lack of agreement results from the failure of the power function of discharge to predict adequately the sediment transport rate above some high-discharge threshold or thresholds. The observed recurrence interval of the effective discharge for the studied streams is highly variable, ranging from a week to several decades, calling into question the widely held notion that effective fluvial discharge occurs about once a year.},

Math. 2, 149-194 (1949),) using the equations of the shallow water theory augmented by the Chezy formula for drag, has shown that the uniform flow becomes unstable when the Froude number F exceeds 4, and in this case he was able to construct a one-parameter family of discontinuous periodic solutions by piecing together continuous sections of wave profile and a series of hydraulic jumps. Here the work of Dressler is extended by the inclusion of a further term that accounts for energy dissipation by shearing normal to the flow. It is shown that the inclusion of such a term does not alter the condition for stability of the uniform flow, and that when the uniform flow is unstable, a one-parameter family of quasi-steady periodic solutions exists (parametrized by the propagation speed U), appearing as a Hopf bifurcation out of the uniform flow at the critical value $U_c = 1 + F^(-\frac{1}{2})$. After the existence of these periodic solutions has been shown, uniformly valid expansions for the periodic solutions are obtained by using the Krylov-Bogoliubov-Mitropolski averaging method, and the results are also extended to larger amplitudes by numerical integration.},

  abstract = {The interactions between turbulence events and sediment motions during bed load transport were studied by means of laser-Doppler velocimetry and high-speed cinematography. Sweeps (u!!e!! > 0, w!!e!! < 0) which contribute positively to the mean bed shear stress, collectively move the majority of the sediment, primarily because they are extremely common. Outward interactions (u!!e!! > 0 w!!e!! > 0) which contribute negatively to the bed shear stress and are relatively rare, individually move as much sediment as sweeps of comparable magnitude and duration, however, and much more than bursts (u!!e!! < 0, w!!e!! > 0) and inward interactions (u!!e!! < 0, w!!e!! < 0). When the magnitude of the outward interactions increases relative to the other events, therefore, the sediment flux increases even though the bed shear stress decreases. Thus, although bed shear stress can be used to estimate bed load transport by flows with well-developed boundary layers, in which the flow is steady and uniform and the turbulence statistics all scale with the shear velocity, it is not accurate for flows with developing boundary layers, such as those over sufficiently nonuniform topography or roughness, in which significant spatial variations in the magnitudes and durations of the sweeps, bursts, outward interactions, and inward interactions occur. These variations produce significant peaks in bed load transport downstream of separation points, thus supporting the hypothesis that flow separation plays a significant role in the development of bed forms.},

  abstract = {An investigation of cellular secondary currents, i.e., threeâ€�dimensional flow patterns, is very important in hydraulic engineering because these currents might cause threeâ€�dimensional sediment distributions and bed configurations such as sand ribbons in straight rivers. It is, however, fairly difficult to measure secondary currents of water flows, even by making use of hotâ€�film anemometers, because the velocity of secondary currents is within 5\% of the mainstream velocity. Thus, on the basis of the hypothesis that the existence of free surface may not be an essential cause of secondary currents, the present study has investigated experimentally the turbulent structure of their currents in air conduit. Considering an essential interaction between secondary currents and bedform, longitudinal ridge elements were attached onto both lower and upper bottoms of the conduit, which simulated the longitudinal ridges and trough of river bedform, i.e., sand ribbons. All three components of the velocity were measured accurately by hotâ€�wire anemometers. The structure of secondary currents was examined through the equations of mean flow vorticity and mean flow energy.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new conceptual model for longitudinal and transverse diffusion of moving bed particles under weak bed load transport. For both rolling/sliding and saltating modes the model suggests that the particle motion is diffusive and comprises at least three ranges of temporal and spatial scales with different diffusion regimes: (1) the local range (ballistic diffusion), (2) the intermediate range (normal or anomalous diffusion), and (3) the global range (subdiffusion). The local range corresponds to ballistic particle trajectories between two successive collisions with the static bed particles. The intermediate range corresponds to particle trajectories between two successive periods of rest. These trajectories consist of many local trajectories and may include tens or hundreds of collisions with the bed. The global range of scales corresponds to particle trajectories consisting of many intermediate trajectories, just as intermediate trajectories consist of many local trajectories. Our data from the Balmoral Canal (the intermediate range) and Drake et al.'s [1988] data from the Duck Creek (the global range) provide strong support for this conceptual model and identify anomalous diffusion regimes for the intermediate range (superdiffusion) and the global range (subdiffusion).},

As an application of the saltation model, bed load transport rates are estimated from modeled mean saltation streamwise velocity and a dynamic friction coefficient.

  abstract = {A high-speed video system was used to study saltation of sand in an open channel flow. High rates of image acquisition provided the information needed to resolve details of the Lagrangian properties of particle motion. Saltation of sand is described in terms of statistical properties of particle trajectories such as mean values and standard deviations of saltation length, height, and streamwise particle velocity. Results are compared with available empirical data. Saltation height seems to be independent of particle size when made dimensionless with the particle diameter; however, the dimensionless saltation length appears to increase as the particle size decreases. Particle collision with the bed is also analyzed. Observations of this process indicate that most of the interactions between saltating particles and the bed are of the collision-rebound type, which contradicts previous discussions on the subject. The estimated value of the dynamic friction coefficient is about half that proposed by Bagnold, in agreement with previous empirical evidence. Friction and restitution coefficients at collision are also estimated from the experimental observations. Nonvanishing values of the latter and values of the former lower than unity are obtained in agreement with previous work with gravel-size particles. Observations of particle resting time, particle reentrainment into saltation, particle rotation, and particle transverse motion during saltation are also presented, providing new insights on the physical processes associated with the saltation phenomenon.},

  abstract  = {We present a new image analysis technique for measuring the grain size distribution (texture) of the bed surface during flow in a laboratory experiment. A camera and a floating device are connected to a carriage used to take images of the bed surface over the entire flume length. The image analysis technique, which is based on color segmentation, provides detailed data on spatial and temporal changes of the areal fraction content of each grain size at the bed surface. The technique was applied in a laboratory experiment conducted to examine a degradational reach composed of a well sorted two-fraction mixture of sand and gravel. The initial bed consisted of an upstream reach that was characterized by an imposed stepwise fining pattern (the bimodal reach) and a downstream sand reach. A lack of sediment supply and partial transport conditions led to the formation of a static armor in the bimodal reach, which resulted in a more abrupt spatial transition in the bed surface mean grain size. The associated spatial transition in slope led to a backwater effect over the bimodal reach, a streamwise reduction in sand mobility, and so a static armor that was governed by a downstream fining pattern. Although a morphodynamic equilibrium state under steady flow is generally characterized by normal flow, here the partial transport regime prevented the bed from adjusting toward normal flow conditions and the morphodynamic steady state was governed by a backwater. We applied a numerical morphodynamic sand-gravel model to reproduce the laboratory experiment. The numerical model captured the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic adjustment and the static armor well, yet the armoring occurred too slowly. Although the final configuration of the experiment shows features of a gravel-sand transition (i.e., a sudden transition in slope and mean grain size), we are hesitant to claim similarities between our results and the physical mechanisms governing a gravel-sand transition in the field.

  abstract = {Insight is provided in hydrodynamic processes governing the velocity redistribution in sharp river bends based on simulations of three recent experiments by means of Blanckaert and de Vriend's (2003, 2010) reduced-order nonlinear model without curvature restrictions. This model successfully simulated the flow redistribution and the secondary flow in all three experiments. The results indicate that the flow redistribution is primarily governed by topographic steering, curvature variations and secondary flow, in a broad range of different configurations, including mildly to sharply curved bends, narrow to shallow bends, smooth to rough bends, bends with additional complexities such as horizontal recirculation zones or patches of riverbed vegetation. The relative importance of these three dominant processes is case dependent, and controlled by the parameters Cfâˆ’1H/B, R/B and streamwise curvature variations. The first parameter characterizes a river reach, whereas the second and third parameters are characteristics of individual bends. Major differences exist between the hydrodynamic processes in mildly and sharply curved bends. First, velocity redistribution induced by curvature variations is negligible in mildly curved bends, but the dominant process in sharp bends. This result is relevant, because most meander models are based on the assumption of weak-curvature variations. Second, nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions play a dominant role in sharp bends, where mild-curvature models overpredict the secondary flow and in some cases even falsely identify it as the dominant process governing the velocity redistribution, which leads to unsatisfactory flow predictions. The reduction in secondary flow strength provoked by the nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions is accompanied by a reduction in the transverse bed slope, which reduces the effect of topographic steering.},

  abstract = {AbstractReducedâ€�order models remain essential tools for meander modeling, especially for processes at large length scales and long time scales, probabilistic simulations, rapid assessments, or when input data are scarce or uncertain. Present reducedâ€�order meander models consider their dependent variables either as smallâ€�amplitude variations compared to a basic state (linearity) or as varying gradually in a spatial sense (gradual variation). In a prequel, Blanckaert and de Vriend () derived a nonlinear reducedâ€�order hydrodynamic model without curvature restrictions and showed that linearity or gradual curvature variations assumptions do not hold in strongly curved channels. Moreover, in strongly curved channels, a nonlinear feedback mechanism causes the secondary flow strength to be smaller than its linear mildâ€�curvature equivalent. In the limit of mildâ€�amplitude variations and mild curvature, their nonlinear meander flow model simplifies to a wellâ€�known linear formulation. The present paper extends this nonlinear modeling to the bed morphology in strongly curved bends, making use of Exner's sediment conservation principle. Furthermore, the model quantifying the relative influence of the downslope gravitational force is refined by considering nonlinear effects. The coupled nonlinear flow and bed morphology model yields satisfactory results for the bed topography, whereas the corresponding linear model strongly overpredicts the magnitude of the transverse bed slope. Analysis of the forcing mechanisms indicate that this erroneous behavior is caused by an overestimation of the upslope drag force due to the secondary flow.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an idealized morphodynamic model to predict river dune evolution. The flow field is solved in a vertical plane assuming hydrostatic pressure conditions. The sediment transport is computed using a Meyer-Peter!!e!!M!!e!!ller type of equation, including gravitational bed slope effects and a critical bed shear stress. To avoid the necessity of modeling the complex flow inside the flow separation zone, we follow an approach similar to one used earlier to simulate the dynamics of wind-blown desert dunes. In case of flow separation, the separation streamline acts as an artificial bed and sediment avalanches down the leeside distributing evenly on the leeside at the angle of repose. Model results show that bed slope effects play a crucial role in the determination of the fastest-growing wavelength from a linear analysis. Flow separation is shown to be crucial to take into account if the dune lee exceeds a certain threshold slope. If flow separation is not included, dune shapes are incorrectly predicted and the dune height saturates at an early stage of bed form evolution, yielding an underprediction of dune height and time to equilibrium. The local bed slope at the dune crest plays a critical role for obtaining an equilibrium dune height. The simulation model is able to predict the main characteristics of dune evolution, such as dune asymmetry, dune growth, and saturation at a certain dune height. Dune dimensions, migration rates, and times to equilibrium compare reasonably well to various data sets.},

The water surface and the bed were imaged simultaneously to create time-dependent maps of the water surface velocities and the bed elevations that can be used to validate numerical models at high spatial and temporal resolution. The technique was applied in a sandy meander bend at the University of Minnesota Saint Anthony Falls Laboratory Outdoor StreamLab. The root mean square differences between optical estimates of the bed and in situ observations ranged between 0.01 and 0.03 m. Mean bed form wavelength was 0.73 m and mean crest height was 0.07 m, but both varied with distance around the meander bend. Bed form classification varied with distance downstream, and sinuosity of bed forms varied with local radius of curvature. Bed form roughness scaled similarly to other natural riverine environments although wavelength and height magnitude and variability were larger than predicted by empirical formulations for straight reaches. Bed form translation rate varied between 1 and 5 mm s!!e!!1. Estimates of velocity from particle image velocimetry (PIV) on the water surface were !!e!!10% higher than in situ observations collected !!e!!0.05 m below the water surface. Using the PIV observations to drive simple equations for bed load sediment flux, we explained up to 72% of the observed variance in downstream sediment flux.

  abstract =  {Quantitative modelling of the filling of sedimentary basins was begun in earnest in the 1960s. Dozens of themes and variations have been proposed since then, and have yielded an abundance of idealized stratigraphic patterns as functions of both imposed changes and basin properties. Post-plate-tectonic modelling began with !!e!!rigid-lid' models, which show the stratigraphic signature of subsidence variation. This work introduced the connection between stratigraphy and the rheology of the lithosphere. Rigid-lid models are the simplest type of geometric model, in which the sediment surface is assigned prescribed geometries, usually corresponding to different depositional environments. These can reproduce many aspects of overall stratal geometry but are formally restricted to relatively long timescales, for which quasi-steady surface topography can be assumed. So-called dynamic models attempt to represent the morphodynamics of the sediment surface by abstracting and averaging short-term transport processes. Most of the dynamic models proposed to date can be seen as special cases of a single general morpho-dynamic equation.The most important result of the first wave of quantitative basin-filling models is that even relatively simple models can produce reasonable stratal patterns. We now have a wide array of tools for exploring scenarios, searching for general behaviours and effects, and making initial quantitative predictions. We have also learned that basin response to external forcing as recorded in stratigraphy can be as sensitive to the characteristics of the basin as to the forcing.The main brake on the development of basin modelling is not computing power but lack of methods and data for testing the models we have already developed. Physical experiments, which are only just beginning, are one means of doing this. Experimental stratigraphy is a bridge to quantitative field tests, which will require collaboration among academic researchers from a wide range of areas, and between academia and industry, on projects of greater scale and degree of integration than we have seen so far. The advancement of quantitative sedimentary geology will also require significant changes in the way the subject is taught, at all levels.},

  abstract  = {Net deposition is necessarily accompanied by overall loss of sediment mass from the transport system; on long time scales the deposition compensates for subsidence and creates the stratigraphic record. Although its spatial pattern changes and it can be locally stopped or reversed, depositional mass loss is a fundamental driving influence on the morphology and behavior of depositional systems. Mass extraction to deposition leads directly to facies changes as sediment flux declines; indirectly it usually leads to down-channel sediment fining as deposition preferentially removes coarser particles. Laboratory experiments illustrate the effects of systematic mass extraction on fluvial channel stacking and deposit grain size, and show how a mass-balance framework allows consistent comparison of facies despite major shifts in depocenter location. Mass-balance analysis of experimental fluvial and turbidite systems, and a turbidite mini-basin from the Gulf of Mexico, show a change from channel-dominated to lobe-dominated deposits at about 80\% total mass extraction. Experimental and field studies also show a close connection between rate of mass loss and rate of downstream grain-size fining, as predicted by a mechanistic theory based on mass balance. These are first steps towards a framework for quantitative basin analysis based on mass extraction. A mass-balance framework allows for consistent, quantitative comparison across basins of varying scale and shape. Mass-balance frameworks can account for overall and/or generic mass-balance effects, and help separate them from local effects. One way to use such generalized models effectively is to view the results as reference cases of down-transport change resulting from the basic interplay of spatial mass-extraction pattern and sediment supply. Where such reference cases do not provide detailed predictions of specific field cases, they can still provide a baseline to separate local, case-specific features from generic system behavior. The approach is analogous to the way the geoid serves as a reference case against which to measure gravity anomalies.},

  abstract = {There has long been debate about the relative importance of abrasion versus selective deposition of the coarsest clasts in causing downstream fining of sediment in river systems. Although high fining rates observed in many natural rivers seem to require strong selective deposition, the ability of selective deposition to produce downstream size sorting has never been measured under controlled conditions. In an experiment using a long flume and a poorly sorted, bimodal gravel feed, downstream fining was produced by a factor of 1.3 in median size and 1.8 in 90th percentile size, over a distance of 21 meters. The experimental conditions rule out abrasion effects. Selective deposition appears to be a natural consequence of the transport and deposition of sufficiently poorly sorted or bimodal gravels and appears to be capable of accounting for fining rates observed in natural gravel rivers.},

  abstract = {The concept of equal mobility of gravel transport is 2 decades old. The weak form of the hypothesis states that in order to transport the coarse half of the mean annual gravel load through a river reach at a rate equal to the fine half, the coarser material must be overrepresented on the bed surface, giving rise to a mobile-bed armor. The degree of mobile-bed armoring necessary to accomplish this diminishes with increasing bed shear stress. The strong form of the hypothesis states that the grain size distribution of the gravel portion of the bed load should be similar to that of the substrate and finer than that of the surface layer. Here the hypothesis is subjected to a rigorous test in the laboratory under controlled conditions which are nevertheless chosen to be as representative as possible of actual field conditions. The grain size distributions used in the experiment included both model and model � At the end of the experiment the entire surface layer and a significant depth of substrate were removed from an entire reach of the channel and sieved. The results of the experiment confirmed the weak form of equal mobility: The surface layer was significantly coarsened compared with the bed load, even when the was excluded from the size distributions. The strong form of equal mobility was also supported by the experiment, in that the size distribution of the �substrate was nearly identical to the size distribution of theportion of the load. The gravel substrate was, however, slightly but measurably coarser than the gravel load, a tendency that has been observed in the field in cases for which the strong form is not satisfied.},

  abstract  = {According to the Bagnold hypothesis for equilibrium bed load transport, a necessary constraint for the maintenance of equilibrium bed load transport is that the fluid shear stress at the bed must be reduced to the critical, or threshold, value associated with incipient motion of grains. It was shown in a companion paper [Seminara et al., 2002], however, that the Bagnold hypothesis breaks down when applied to equilibrium bed load transport on beds with transverse slopes above a relatively modest value that is well below the angle of repose. An investigation of this failure resulted in a demonstration of its lack of validity even for nearly horizontal beds. The constraint is here replaced with an entrainment formulation, according to which a dynamic equilibrium is maintained by a balance between entrainment of bed grains into the bed load layer and deposition of bed load grains onto the bed. The entrainment function is formulated so that the entrainment rate is an increasing function of the excess of the fluid shear stress at the bed over the threshold value. The formulation is implemented with the aid of a unique set of laboratory data that characterizes equilibrium bed load transport at relatively low shear stresses for streamwise angles of bed inclination varying from nearly 0!!e!! to 22!!e!!. The formulation is shown to provide a description of bed load transport on nearly horizontal beds that fits the data as well as that resulting from the Bagnold constraint. The entrainment formulation has the added advantage of not requiring the unrealistically high dynamic coefficient of Coulomb friction resulting from the Bagnold constraint. Finally, the entrainment formulation provides reasonable and consistent results on finite streamwise and transverse bed slopes, even those at which the Bagnold formulation breaks down completely.},

  abstract  = {Rivers and canals with perimeters composed of non-cohesive sand and silt have self-formed active beds and banks. They thus provide a most interesting fluid flow problem, for which one must determine the container as well as the flow. If bed load alone occurs across the perimeter of a wide channel, gravity will pull particles down the lateral slope of the banks; bank erosion is accomplished and the channel widens. In order to maintain equilibrium, this export of material from the banks must be countered by an import of sediment from the channel centre.The mechanism postulated for this import is lateral diffusion of suspended sediment, which overloads the flow near the banks and causes deposition. The model is formulated analytically with the aid of a series of approximate but reasonable assumptions. Singular perturbation techniques are used to define the channel geometry and obtain rational regime relations for straight channels. A comparison with data lends credence to the model.It is hoped that a first step has been made towards a more general treatment, which would include various complicating factors that are important features of natural rivers but are not essential to the maintenance of channel width. Among these factors are meandering, sediment sorting and seepage.},

A theory of two-dimensional bed load transport of graded material, including the effects of gravity on lateral slopes and secondary currents, is developed. This theory is coupled with a simple treatment of flow in bends, an analytically determined bend shape, and the condition of continuity of each grain size range in transport to describe sorting. The theory indicates that the locus of coarse sediment shifts from the inside bank to the outside bank near the bend apex, as is observed.},

  abstract =  {Most past studies of river dune dynamics have concentrated on two-dimensional (2-D) bed forms, with constant heights and straight crest lines transverse to the flow, and their associated turbulent flow structure. This morphological simplification imposes inherent limitations on the interpretation and understanding of dune form and flow dynamics in natural channels, where dune form is predominantly three-dimensional. For example, studies over 2-D forms neglect the significant influence that lateral flows and secondary circulation may have on the flow structure and thus dune morphology. This paper details a field study of a swath of 3-D dunes in the Rio Paran!!e!!, Argentina. A large (0.35 km wide, 1.2 km long) area of dunes was surveyed using a multibeam echo sounder (MBES) that provided high-resolution 3-D detail of the river bed. Simultaneous with the MBES survey, 3-D flow information was obtained with an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP), revealing a complicated pattern of dune morphology and associated flow structure within the swath. Dune three-dimensionality appears intimately connected to the morphology of the upstream dune, with changes in crest line curvature and crest line bifurcations/junctions significantly influencing the downstream dune form. Dunes with lobe or saddle-shaped crest lines were found to have larger, more structured regions of vertical velocity with smaller separation zones than more 2-D straight-crested dunes. These results represent the first integrated study of 3-D dune form and mean flow structure from the field and show several similarities to recent laboratory models of flow over 3-D dunes.},

  abstract = {Abstract Tracer pebbles are often used to study bed load transport processes in gravel bed rivers. Models have been proposed for their downstream dispersion, and also for vertical dispersion, but not for the combined effects of downstream and vertical movement. Here we use the Exner-Based Master Equation to characterize the transient coevolution of streamwise and vertical advection-diffusion of tracer pebbles under equilibrium transport conditions (no net aggradation or degradation). The coevolution of streamwise and vertical dispersion gives rise to behavior that can differ markedly from that associated with purely streamwise processes with no vertical exchange. One example is streamwise advective slowdown. Particles that are advected downward into zones where the probability of reentrainment becomes asymptotically small are essentially trapped and can no longer participate in streamwise advection. As a result, the mean streamwise velocity of the tracer plume declines in time. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with two field experiments show encouraging agreement despite the simplified boundary conditions in the model.},

However, problems of sampling submerged substrates has constrained investigations of channel substrate pollution. This paper illustrates the utility of a freeze-sampling technique for gravel-bed rivers that may be used to obtain quantitative determinations of fine sediments. Potential applications are illustrated by two case studies. The first shows that flood control can lead to the sedimentation and compaction of gravel substrates. The second shows that high metal concentrations can exist within gravel substrates of urban rivers. Both studies demonstrate that the method can be used to establish fine sediment and contaminant profiles for the upper 30 cm of gravel substrates !!e!! the critical zone for biota.},

  abstract = {In many gravel-bedded rivers, floods that fill the channel banks create just enough shear stress to move the median-sized gravel particles on the bed surface (D50). Because this observation is common and is supported by theory, the coincidence of bankfull flow and the incipient motion of D50 has become a commonly used assumption. However, not all natural gravel channels actually conform to this simple relationship; some channels maintain bankfull stresses far in excess of the critical stress required to initiate sediment transport. We use a database of >300 gravel-bedded rivers and >600 10Be-derived erosion rates from across North America to explore the hypothesis that sediment supply drives the magnitude of bankfull shear stress relative to the critical stress required to mobilize the median bed surface grain size (!!e!!bf*/!!e!!c*). We find that !!e!!bf*/!!e!!c* is significantly higher in West Coast river reaches (2.35, n = 96) than in river reaches elsewhere on the continent (1.03, n = 245). This pattern parallels patterns in erosion rates (and hence sediment supplies). Supporting our hypothesis, we find a significant correlation between upstream erosion rate and local !!e!!bf*/!!e!!c* at sites where this comparison is possible. Our analysis reveals a decrease in bed surface armoring with increasing !!e!!bf*/!!e!!c*, suggesting channels accommodate changes in sediment supply through adjustments in bed surface grain size, as also shown through numerical modeling. Our findings demonstrate that sediment supply is encoded in the bankfull hydraulic geometry of gravel bedded channels through its control on bed surface grain size.},

  abstract = {Sediment transport is an intrinsically stochastic process, and measurement of bed load in the environment is further complicated by the unsteady nature of river flooding. Here we present a methodology for analyzing sediment tracer data with unsteady forcing. We define a dimensionless impulse by integrating the cumulative excess shear velocity for the duration of measurement, normalized by grain size. We analyze the dispersion of a plume of cobble tracers in a very flashy stream over two years. The mean and variance of transport distance collapse onto well-defined linear and power-law relations, respectively, when plotted against cumulative dimensionless impulse. Data suggest that the asymptotic limit of bed load tracer dispersion is superdiffusive, in line with a broad class of geophysical flows exhibiting strong directional asymmetry (advection), thin-tailed step lengths and heavy-tailed waiting times. The impulse framework justifies the use of quasi-steady flow approximations for long-term river evolution modeling.},

  abstract  = {Large floods should seemingly influence the depth and width of rivers. Phillips and Jerolmack, however, suggest that the self-organization of bedrock river channels blunts the impact of extreme rainfall events. River channel geometries from a wide range of course-grained rivers across the United States show that larger floods have very limited additional impact on channel geometry. River channel sculpting does increase as flood size increases, but the effect is most pronounced for moderate floods. This relationship may explain the long-term stability of rivers across shifts in climate.Science, this issue p. 694Spatial and temporal variations in rainfall are hypothesized to influence landscape evolution through erosion and sediment transport by rivers. However, determining the relation between rainfall and river dynamics requires a greater understanding of the feedbacks between flooding and a river{\textquoteright}s capacity to transport sediment. We analyzed channel geometry and stream-flow records from 186 coarse-grained rivers across the United States. We found that channels adjust their shape so that floods slightly exceed the critical shear velocity needed to transport bed sediment, independently of climatic, tectonic, and bedrock controls. The distribution of fluid shear velocity associated with floods is universal, indicating that self-organization of near-critical channels filters the climate signal evident in discharge. This effect blunts the impact of extreme rainfall events on landscape evolution.},

  abstract = {An overview of the proceedings of the 1992 Geomorphology symposium on Geomorphic Systems several trends. First, there is a pervasive concern with the presence and nature of geomorphic equilibria. However, the focus is not on detection of a single, stable equilibrium condition for geomorphic systems, but on the behavior of systems away from equilibrium, the presence and prevalence of dis- and nonequilibrium forms, and the presence of multiple equilibria for a given systems. A second major theme is the nonlinear behavior of geomorphic systems. This nonlinearity provides a bridge between existing threshold concepts in the discipline and the emerging study of earth surface phenomena as complex nonlinear dynamical systems. In connection with this, the critical role of feedback mechanisms in geomorphic systems emerges as a third general theme. Finally, a number of papers implicity or explicity raise the possibility of universality -i.e., that there are universal properties of geomorphic system behavior independent of location- and time-specific controls. Taken as a whole, the symposium papers are interpreted as signalling the possible end of classic equilibrium studies in the sense of searching for a single or typical equilibrium response to a given set of processes or controls. Conceptual frameworks which emphasize, or at least include, nonequilibrium responses and multiple equilibria are on the ascension. Historical perspectives suggest that these new developments are not necessarily inconsistent with prevailing and traditional geomorphic thought.},

  abstract  = {Estimates of three flows categorised as dominant discharge are derived for Cumberland Basin streams: the most effective discharge with regard to bed-load transport, the 1.58-year flood and the natural bankfull discharge. The most effective discharge is found to have a return period of 1.15!!e!!1.40 years on the annual series but is much smaller than the 1.58-year flood. Bankfull discharge return periods lie mainly within the range 4!!e!!10 years on the annual series. Observations of channel changes in Crawfords Creek indicate that the characteristics of the bed are related to flows similar to the most effective discharge but these flows do not erode the banks. Instead, bank erosion seems related to much larger floods. It is suggested that many Cumberland Basin streams are not incised but that their capacity is determined by large floods. Two groups of flows, therefore, seem to determine channel characteristics: the small flows which transport most of the bed load and the large flows which determine channel capacity. The reason for this lies in the hydrologic and sedimentary characteristics of Cumberland Basin streams. Streamflow appears to be dominated by two populations of runoff events, while channel bed material contains little fine to medium sand. Together, these two factors modify the typical process balance involved in channel and floodplain formation.},

  abstract  = {Sedimentological studies of coarse-grained alluvial rivers reveal patterns of bed material sorting at a variety of spatial scales ranging from downstream fining over the length of the long profile to the vertical segregation of a coarse surface layer at the scale of individual particles. This article reviews the mechanisms that sort bed material by size during sediment entrainment, transport and deposition and discusses some of the inter-relationships that exist between patterns and processes of sediment sorting at different spatial and temporal scales. At initiation of motion, sorting can arise from the preferential entrainment of the finer fractions from the heterogeneous bed sediments. Bedload grain-size distributions are modified during transport as different size fractions are routed along different transport pathways under the influence of nonuniform bed topography and associated flow patterns, and during deposition as the variable pocket geometry of the rough bed surface and turbulence intensity of the flow control the size of the particles that deposit. The review highlights the poor understanding of the many feedback linkages that exist between patterns and processes of sediment sorting at different scales and the need for a greater awareness of the spatial and temporal bounds of these linkages.},

  abstract = {The path length (downstream displacement over a given time period) of individual bed particles in gravel-bed rivers is central to morphological methods for measuring bed load transport rate and is also fundamental to understanding the bed load transport process and the development of channel morphology. Previous studies of particle movement using tracers report predominantly strongly positively skewed frequency distributions of path length with modes close to the point of entrainment. However, gravel-bed rivers often have regularly spaced erosion (scour pools) and deposition (channel bars) sites that are several channel widths apart and it is reasonable to expect that particle path length would reflect this morphological scale, at least during flows large enough to create and modify the morphology. Here, we synthesize and re-analyze results from published bed load tracing experiments in gravel-bed rivers to identify the variety of possible path length distributions for differing channel morphology, channel dimensions, bed particle size, and particle mobility (i.e. flow magnitude) and to look for occurrences of path length coinciding with the length scale of the morphology. The results show that path length distributions may be positively skewed, symmetrical, and uni-, bi-, or multi-modal and may include modes that coincide with known or expected poolâ€“bar spacing. Primary path length modes equivalent to possible poolâ€“bar spacing are more probable at higher non-dimensional bed shear stress, from which it is inferred that both particle mobility and channel morphology exert an influence on particle path lengths and that particle movement is unlikely to be stochastic except at relatively low particle mobility. Existing data are inadequate for more than a preliminary analysis of this problem consequently there is a need for new data collected explicitly and systematically to confirm these preliminary results, isolate the effect of the several variables that influence the characteristics of path length frequency distributions and identify the conditions under which path length coincides with the length scale of the dominant morphology.},

The model is coupled, explicitly incorporating the flow!!e!!sediment!!e!!bed interactions by using the full mass and momentum conservation equations, which are numerically solved by a well-balanced version of the finite volume Slope Limiter Centred (SLIC) scheme. The model is first tested against a flume experiment on alternate bars formed over a uniform sediment bed, which clearly exhibits processes of bar formation, migrating and finally approaching an equilibrium state. Then it is applied to another flume experiment on alternate bars due to non-uniform sediment transport. The computational results are evaluated, with a focus on the longitudinal and vertical sediment sorting. It is argued for the first time that the inconsistent sediment sorting patterns observed in previous studies are determined by different sediment transport conditions, i.e. full versus partial transport. When a condition of full transport is achieved, under which all size fractions are fully mobilized and transported, the longitudinal surface sediment shows a sorting pattern of coarse-on-head and fine-in-pool, and the vertical substrate sediment exhibits an immobile-fine-coarse structure upwards. In contrast, for a partial transport condition, under which only finer fraction participates in the transport process, an opposite longitudinal pattern (i.e. fine-on-head and coarse-in-pool) and a different vertical structure (i.e. immobile-coarse-fine) are observed. Concurrently, numerical experiments with specified conditions show that the critical aspect ratio for the formation of migrating alternate bars is approximately equal to 12. With the increase of the aspect ratio, the bar length grows gradually, while the bar height increases rapidly for moderate values of the aspect ratio and then keeps nearly stable. The bar celerity, however, is weakly sensitive to the variation of this ratio. Copyright !!e!! 2016 John Wiley  \&  Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Several secondary flow correction models have been proposed in the literature to account for the 3d flow characteristics of secondary flow which is often lost in depth-averaged hydrodynamic model. In this paper two typical correction models are selected as representatives which are Lien (L) and Bernard (B) models. And one singular bend channel and one meandering channel are applied to evaluate their performances in flow simulation. The simulation results in water surface level and longitudinal velocity distributions across sections of L and B model are compared with that of traditional depth-averaged model with no correction (N model). The results show that the water surface level of B model is a bit higher than that of the other models in the two flumes. As for velocity simulation results, B model performs best by comparison with the other two models, especially when the channel bends become complex. B and L model mainly improves the velocity simulation results around the wall region. The velocity distributions of L model become irrational in flow simulation of the complex meandering channel. While B model works well in sharply curved channel and complex meandering channel. Therefore, B model is applicable for flow simulation in meandering channels. The analysis of the distribution of correction terms of B model demonstrate that the correction term is at the same order of the viscosity stress term and the maximum values of it are around the wall region which enabled the redistribution of the longitudinal velocities.},

  abstract  = {Taking as an example six main rivers that drain the western flank of the Eastern Carpathians, a conceptual model has been developed, according to which fluvial bed sediment bimodality can be explained by the overlapping of two grain size distribution curves of different origins.Thus, for Carpathian tributaries of the Siret, coarse gravel joins an unimodal distribution presenting a right skewness with enhanced downstream fining. The source of the coarse material distributions is autohtonous (by abrasion and hydraulic sorting mechanisms). A second distribution with a sandy mode is, in general, skewed to the left. The source of the second distribution is allohtonous (the quantity of sand that reaches the river-bed through the erosion of the hillslope basin terrains). The intersection of the two distributions occurs in the area of the 0!!e!!5!!e!!8 mm fractions, where, in fact, the right skewness (for gravel) and left skewness (for sand) histogram tails meet. This also explains the lack of particles in the 0!!e!!5!!e!!8 mm interval. For rivers where fine sediment sources are low, the 0!!e!!5!!e!!8 mm fractions have a higher proportion than the fractions under 1 mm.For the Siret River itself, bed sediment bimodality is greatly enhanced due to the fact that the second mode is more than 25% of the full sample. As opposed to its tributaries, the source of the first mode, of gravel, is allohtonous to the Siret river, generated by the massive input of coarse sediment through the Carpathian tributaries, while the second mode, of the sands, is local. In this case we can also observe that the two distributions of particles of different origins overlap in the 0!!e!!5!!e!!8 mm fraction domain, creating the illusion of !!e!!particle lack!!e!! in the fluvial bed sediments.

  abstract = {Dividing flows in open channels are commonly encountered in hydraulic engineering systems. They are inherently three-dimensional (3D) in character. Past experimental studies were mostly limited to the collection of test data on the assumption that the flow was 1D or 2D. In the present experimental study, the flow is treated as 3D and test results are obtained for the flow characteristics of dividing flows in a 90!!e!!, sharp-edged, rectangular open-channel junction formed by channels of equal width. Depth measurements are made using point gauges, while velocity measurements are obtained using a Dantec laser Doppler anemometer over grids defined throughout the junction region. A 3D turbulence model is also developed to investigate the dividing open-channel flow characteristics. The predicted flow characteristics are validated using experimental data. Following proper model validation, the numerical model developed can yield design data pertaining to flow characteristics for different discharge and area ratios for other dividing flow configurations encountered in engineering practice. Energy and momentum coefficients based on the present 3D model yield more realistic energy losses and momentum transfers for dividing flow configurations. Data related to secondary flows provide information vital to bank stability, if the branch channel sides are erodible.},

Primarily due to the massive increase in modeling time scales it affords, the \{MORFAC\} approach is now standard in state-of-the-art commercially available coastal morphodynamic modeling suites. However, the general validity of the \{MORFAC\} concept for coastal applications has not yet been comprehensively investigated. Furthermore, a robust and objective method (as opposed to the subjective and inelegant trial and error method) for the a priori determination of the highest \{MORFAC\} that is suitable for a given simulation (i.e. critical MORFAC) does not currently exist. This communication presents some initial results of an ongoing, long-term study that attempts to rigorously and methodically investigate the limitations and strengths of the \{MORFAC\} approach. Based on the results of a strategically designed numerical modeling exercise using the morphodynamic model Delft3D, two main outcomes are presented. First, the main dependencies and sensitivities of the \{MORFAC\} approach to fundamental forcing conditions and model parameters are elucidated. Second, a criterion based on the Courant!!e!!Friedrichs!!e!!Levy (CFL) condition for bed form propagation that maybe used as a guide to determine the critical \{MORFAC\} a priori is proposed.},

Both in flume and field experiments, these fluctuations were often associated with migration of low-relief bed forms called bed load sheets. Whereas several studies have described bed load sheets as a consequence of grain sorting, little is known about the mechanisms responsible for their production and migration. These were investigated in flume experiments. A set of 20 experiments was conducted under constant feeding rate conditions, with mixtures of different uniform sediments and for slopes varying from 0.8 to 9%. Except for runs performed in high flow conditions, we observed periodic bed load sheet production and migration associated with fluctuations of bed slope, bed state (bed fining and paving), and bed load. Observations allowed us to conclude that bed load sheets resulted from very efficient vertical and longitudinal grain sorting that produced periodic local bed aggradation and erosion clearly observed in the upstream section of the flume. Fractional transport rates were measured in one run. Combined with the results of experiments previously conducted by authors with uniform sediments, this experiment showed that the highest (peak) solid discharges were essentially caused by the much greater mobility of the coarser gravels when transported within bed load sheets. A scenario is proposed for the mechanisms involved in bed load sheet production and migration.},

  abstract = {For morphodynamic studies, it is important to compute not only the transported volumes of bed load, but also the size of the transported material. A few bed load equations compute fractional transport (i.e., both the volume and grain size distribution), but many equations compute only the bulk transport (a volume) with no consideration of the transported grain sizes. To fill this gap, a method is proposed to compute the bed load grain size distribution separately to the bed load flux. The method is called the Generalized Threshold Model (GTM), because it extends the flow competence method for threshold of motion of the largest transported grain size to the full bed surface grain size distribution. This was achieved by replacing dimensional diameters with their size indices in the standard hiding function, which offers a useful framework for computation, carried out for each indices considered in the range [1, 100]. New functions are also proposed to account for partial transport. The method is very simple to implement and is sufficiently flexible to be tested in many environments. In addition to being a good complement to standard bulk bed load equations, it could also serve as a framework to assist in analyzing the physics of bed load transport in future research.},

  abstract = {The validity of a bed-load transport formula, based on the bed-shear concept of Meyer-Peter and Mueller, was investigated for steady unidirectional flows, oscillatory flows and oscillatory flows with superimposed net currents. The aim of the study was to develop a general bed-load transport concept for a wide range of flow and sediment conditions, as occurring in the marine coastal environment. The results of more than 150 laboratory experiments, including more than 75 recent bed-load transport measurements in oscillating water tunnels, were used for the study. For oscillatory flows, the time-dependent bed-load transport was treated in a `quasi-steady' way and an equivalent Shields parameter !!e!!eq!!e!! was defined in order to enable a comparison between `steady fow' and `unsteady oscillatory flow' measurements. A good correlation was found between the non-dimensional transport parameter !!e!!b and the non-dimensional excess bed-shear !!e!!eq!!e!!c for different sets of oscillatory bed-load transport measurements. However, especially in the lower Shields regime, the oscillatory flow data show a clear deviation from an extensive set of steady flow bed-load data. A good agreement between the (oscillatory flow and the steady flow) data sets could then be obtained by reducing the lower limit of the roughness height ks for oscillatory flows from the (steady flow) value 3D90 to D50. Based on the obtained concept a generalized bed-load formula was derived for both flow types, including oscillatory flows and superimposed currents under an arbitrary angle. A verification, carried out with a set of (co-linear) oscillatory+superimposed current measurements, showed a good agreement between calculated and measured bed-load transport rates. Finally, the validity and limitations of the obtained bed-load model are discussed.},

  abstract = {A field study was carried out to investigate the development of alternate bars in a secondary channel of the Loire River (France) as a function of discharge variations. We combined frequent bathymetric surveys, scour chains and stratigraphical analysis of deposits with measurements and modelling of flow dynamics. The channel exhibited migrating bars, non-migrating bars and superimposed dunes. Possible mechanisms of bar initiation were found to be chutes associated with changes of bank direction and instability resulting from interactions between existing bars during the fall in water level after floods. We propose that the reworking of bar sediments during low flows (high width-to-depth ratio), reinforced by high values of the Shields mobility parameter, can explain the formation or re-generation of new alternate migrating bars during a subsequent flood. The migration pattern of the bars was found to be cyclic and to depend mainly on (i) channel layout and (ii) the dynamics of superimposed dunes with heights and lengths depending on location and discharge value. For instance, the hysteresis affecting the steepness of dunes influences the flow resistance of the dunes as well as the celerity of migrating bars during flood events. We compare the findings from the field with results from theoretical studies on alternate bars. This gives insight in the phenomena occurring in the complex setting of real rivers, but it also sheds light on the extent to which bar theories based on idealized cases can predict those phenomena.

  abstract = {A classification system for natural rivers is presented in which a morphological arrangement of stream characteristics is organized into relatively homogeneous stream types. This paper describes morphologically similar stream reaches that are divided into 7 major stream type categories that differ in entrenchment, gradient, width/depth ratio, and sinuosity in various landforms. Within each major category are six additional types delineated by dominate channel materials from bedrock to silt/clay along a continuum of gradient ranges. Recent stream type data used to further define classification interrelationships were derived from 450 rivers throughout the U.S, Canada, and New Zealand. Data used in the development of this classification involved a great diversity of hydro-physiographic/geomorphic provinces from small to large rivers and in catchments from headwater streams in the mountains to the coastal plains. A stream hierarchical inventory system is presented which utilizes the stream classification system. Examples for use of this stream classification system for engineering, fish habitat enhancement, restoration and water resource management applications are presented. Specific examples of these applications include hydraulic geometry relations, sediment supply/availability, fish habitat structure evaluation, flow resistance, critical shear stress estimates, shear stress/velocity relations, streambank erodibility potential, management interpretations, sequences of morphological evolution, and river restoration principles.},

In this paper, a broad overview is given of verification procedures for computational simulation. The two aspects of verification examined are code verification and solution verification. Code verification is a set of procedures developed to find coding mistakes that affect the numerical discretization. The method of manufactured solutions combined with order of accuracy verification is recommended for code verification, and this procedure is described in detail. Solution verification is used to estimate the numerical errors that occur in every computational simulation. Both round-off and iterative convergence errors are discussed, and a posteriori methods for estimating the discretization error are examined. Emphasis is placed on discretization error estimation methods based on Richardson extrapolation as they are equally applicable to any numerical method. Additional topics covered include calculating the observed order of accuracy, error bands, and practical aspects of mesh refinement.},

  abstract  = {A new measurement method for continuous detection of bed forms in movable bed laboratory experiments is presented and tested. The device consists of a line laser coupled to a 3â€�D camera, which makes use of triangulation. This allows to measure bed forms during morphodynamic experiments, without removing the water from the flume. A correction is applied for the effect of laser refraction at the airâ€�water interface. We conclude that the absolute measurement error increases with increasing flow velocity, its standard deviation increases with water depth and flow velocity, and the percentage of missing values increases with water depth. Although 71% of the data is lost in a pilot moving bed experiment with sand, still high agreement between flowing water and dry bed measurements is found when a robust LOcally weighted regrESSion (LOESS) procedure is applied. This is promising for bed form tracking applications in laboratory experiments, especially when lightweight sediments like polystyrene are used, which require smaller flow velocities to achieve dynamic similarity to the prototype. This is confirmed in a moving bed experiment with polystyrene. A new line laser scanner approach improves bed level monitoring in morphodynamic experiments A LOESS fitting algorithm allows to handle outliers and missing data effectively The best results are obtained for small flow velocities commonly used in experiments with lightâ€�weight sediment},

  abstract = {Altered flow and sediment transport regimes from impoundment can result in significant channel bed composition changes that exacerbate the geomorphic and ecological effects of flow regulation. Using long-term discharge and cross-sectional data in combination with a two-fraction sediment transport model, we assess changes in the downstream bed of two flow-regulated rivers with equivalent dam-induced changes in flow but opposite changes in sediment flux. Supply limitation has led to incision and armoring in one case while supply excess has led to aggradation and embeddedness in the other. Under limited sediment supply, bed elevation variability decreases soon after impoundment, while excess sediment supply results in a decades-long gradual decrease in both bed elevation variability and depth of incision. Although the balance of sediment supply and transport differs between dam management styles, in both cases both the immediate and more gradual changes can be explained within the framework of a two-fraction sediment transport model. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering bed composition on sediment transport predictions and the development of management strategies for ecosystem maintenance.},

High-resolution (1 s) time series of sediment transport were measured for individual grain-size classes at the outlet of the flume for different combinations of sediment input rates and flow discharges. Our aim in this paper is to quantify (a) the relation of discharge and sediment transport and (b) the nature and strength of memory in grain-size-dependent transport. None of the simple statistical descriptors of sediment transport (mean, extreme values, and quantiles) display a clear relation with water discharge, in fact a large variability between discharge and sediment transport is observed. Instantaneous transport rates have probability density functions with heavy tails. Bed load bursts have a coarser grain-size distribution than that of the entire experiment. We quantify the strength and nature of memory in sediment transport rates by estimating the Hurst exponent and the autocorrelation coefficient of the time series for different grain sizes. Our results show the presence of the Hurst phenomenon in transport rates, indicating long-term memory which is grain-size dependent. The short-term memory in coarse grain transport increases with temporal aggregation and this reveals the importance of the sampling duration of bed load transport rates in natural streams, especially for large fractions.},

  abstract  = {Particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) was used to quantify the entire two-dimensional flow field over a series of fixed test beds in a laboratory flume. The test beds used in the experiments provide a two-dimensional representation of gravel beds with contrasting roughness. The two-dimensional form of the beds, combined with the nonintrusive nature of PIV, allowed the velocity field to be quantified right down to the bed surface. The three beds used were designed to simulate the progressive effect of sand deposition on a gravel bed with median grain size (D50) of 25 mm. Such a situation is common in bimodal beds, but, as compared with gravel and sand cases, little work has been done to investigate the interaction between the variable roughness of a bimodal bed and the flow structure above it. The results demonstrate that as the effective roughness decreases the reverse flow often found in the lee of gravel particles is eliminated. Furthermore, near-bed velocities increase, while shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy decrease. Turbulent properties are also diminished higher up in the profile, although this is not the case for the mean downstream velocity, which remains unaffected except at the bed. Quadrant analysis reveals that Q2 and Q4 events become less frequent around high points as effective roughness decreases. All these responses to the changing bed conditions are most pronounced in areas where the effective roughness height (h) approaches 10 mm or less (h/D50 = 0.4). Such a situation is often found immediately upstream of gravel-sand transitions in natural rivers. It is hypothesized that the hydraulic response outlined here provides a detailed physically based explanation for the gravel-sand transition; the combination of reduced bed shear stress and Q2/Q4 events around gravel particles will result in greater mobility of the sand fraction relative to gravel. These experiments thus appear to demonstrate that there is a fundamental threshold between gravel bed and sand bed states that has not previously been quantified.},

  abstract = {Abstract The Jamuna River is the downstream continuation of the Brahmaputra in Bangladesh. It is one of the largest sand-bed braided rivers in the world and every year it erodes thousand hectares of mainland floodplain, rendering tens of thousands of people landless and/or homeless. Understanding the morpho-dynamics of this river and its responses to the various drivers of morphological change that act on it is essential to improving the livelihoods of millions of floodplain dwellers in Bangladesh, especially given the threats posed by climate change. Reliable data, information and knowledge of river process are sparse and so progress in linking the impacts of multiple drivers (including neo-tectonics, earthquakes, large-scale avulsions and engineering interventions) to complex morphological responses depends on making best use of historical maps, time-series satellite images, hydro-morphological data, expert judgment and local knowledge. This paper draws on all these sources to chronicle the morphological evolution of the Jamuna River since the avulsion that created it about 200 years ago, and to establish temporal trends and spatial patterns in the changes that have characterized process!!e!!response mechanisms in this fluvial system since then. The understanding gained from these investigations then supports deeper analyses to: explain how historical migration of the river westward has produced significant contrasts between left and right (west) bank material properties; elucidate the relationships between discharge, fluvial processes, anabranch instability and floodplain erosion rates, and; identify causal links between drivers and morphological responses at a variety of time and space scales. Finally, the new knowledge generated by the analyses developed herein are combined with existing, conceptual and empirical process!!e!!response models for the Jamuna to predict possible future morphological adjustments in ways helpful in identifying appropriate strategies for climate change adaptation in Bangladesh. The enhanced knowledge gained from these historical and contemporary investigations may also be useful in assessing the impacts of natural and anthropogenic drivers on other large, braided rivers.},

  abstract = {The Brahmaputra River finds its origin in the Chema Yundung glacier of Tibet and flows through India and Bangladesh. The slope of the river decreases suddenly in front of the Himalayas and results in the deposition of sediment and a braided channel pattern. It flows through Assam, India, along a valley comprising its own Recent alluvium. In Assam the basin receives 300 cm mean annual rainfall, 66!!e!!85% of which occurs in the monsoon period from June through September. Mean annual discharge at Pandu for 1955!!e!!1990 is 16,682.24 m3 s!!e!! 1. Average monthly discharge is highest in July (19%) and lowest in February (2%). Most hydrographs exhibit multiple flood peaks occurring at different times from June to September. The mean annual suspended sediment load is 402 million tons and average monthly sediment discharge is highest in June (19.05%) and lowest in January (1.02%). The bed load at Pandu was found to be 5!!e!!15% of the total load of the river. Three kinds of major geomorphic units are found in the basin. The river bed of the Brahmaputra shows four topographic levels, with increasing height and vegetation. The single first order primary channels of this braided river split into two or more smaller second order channels separated by bars and islands. The second order channels are of three kinds. The maximum length and width of the bars in the area under study are 18.43 km and 6.17 km, respectively. The Brahmaputra channel is characterised by mid-channel bars, side bars, tributary mouth bars and unit bars. The geometry of meandering tributary rivers shows that the relationship between meander wavelength and bend radius is most linear. The Brahmaputra had been undergoing overall aggradation by about 16 cm during 1971 to 1979. The channel of the Brahmaputra River has been migrating because of channel widening and avulsion. The meandering tributaries change because of neck cut-off and progressive shifting at the meander bends. The braiding index of the Brahmaputra has been increasing from 6.11 in 1912!!e!!1928 to 8.33 in 1996. During the twentieth century, the total amount of bank area lost from erosion was 868 km2. Maximum rate of shift of the north bank to south resulting in erosion was 227.5 m/year and maximum rate of shift of the south bank to north resulting in accretion was 331.56 m/year. Shear failure of upper bank and liquefaction of clayey-silt materials are two main causes of bank erosion.},

Their equation systems typically lose hyperbolicity when the relative velocities between layers become too large, which is associated with Kelvin!!e!!Helmholtz instabilities involving turbulent momentum exchanges between the layers. Focusing on the two-layer case, we present a numerical improvement that locally avoids the loss of hyperbolicity. The proposed modification introduces an additional momentum exchange between layers, whose value is iteratively calculated to be strictly sufficient to keep the system hyperbolic. The approach can be easily implemented in any finite volume scheme and there is no limitation concerning the density ratio between layers. Numerical examples, employing both HLL-type and Roe-type approximate Riemann solvers, are reported to validate the method and its key features.},

Despite their importance, key unknowns remain, perhaps foremost of which is evaluating in steep streams empirical laws for fluvial sediment transport developed for low-gradient rivers. To address this knowledge gap, we painted sediment in situ over 3?years to monitor incipient sediment motion and sediment-patch development in five small (drainage areas of 0.04�2?km2) and steep (slopes of 5�37%) tributaries of Elder Creek, California, United States. We found that channel beds organized into size-sorted sediment patches which displayed active fluvial transport of gravel annually, consistent year-to-year patch median grain sizes, partial transport of bed material, and significantly higher values of critical Shields stress for incipient sediment motion compared to that observed for lower gradient rivers. The high critical Shields stresses (up to ?0.5 for the median grain size) agree within a factor of ~3 to theoretical predictions which account for slope-dependent hydraulics, grain hiding, and sediment patches. For grains of approximately the same size as the roughness length scale, slope-dependent hydraulics and bed patchiness are the dominant controls on critical Shields stress values, while grain hiding is important for grains larger or smaller than the roughness length scale. Form drag exists in our monitored tributaries but has a smaller influence than the above effects. Our field observations show fluvial processes contribute to sediment mobilization in steep channels which are often considered to be dominated by debris flows.},

Existing bedrock incision models diverge on the ability of sediment to erode within the suspension regime, leading to competing predictions of lowland river erosion rates, knickpoint formation and evolution, and the transient response of orogens to external forcing. We present controlled abrasion mill experiments designed to test fluvial incision models in the bedload and suspension regimes by varying sediment size while holding fixed hydraulics, sediment load, and substrate strength. Measurable erosion occurred within the suspension regime, and erosion rates agree with a mechanistic incision theory for erosion by mixed suspended and bedload sediment. Our experimental results indicate that suspension-regime erosion can dominate channel incision during large floods and in steep channels, with significant implications for the pace of landscape evolution.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper reports results from bedload transport investigations with active (radio) and passive (iron, magnetic) tracers in the Lainbach, a step-pool mountain river, in Bavaria, Southern Germany. The spatial distributions of the iron tracers after flood events can be best described by exponential or Gamma distributions. There is some indication of a tendency of size-selective transport of the iron tracers, but there is also a considerable amount of scatter in the correlations between weight (size) and travel length owing to the masking influence of other variables, such as the shape of the particles and different positions in the river bed. The experiments with artificial magnetic tracers showed that elongated pebbles (rods) had the longest mean transport distance, platy ones (discs) remained relatively close to the starting points. The particles from the pool showed the greatest transport lengths and a 100 per cent chance of being eroded. The Pebble Transmitter System (PETSY) consists of transmitters implanted into individual pebbles, a computerized receiver, a stationary antenna system with an antenna switchboard, and a data logging system. The particles do not move continuously but in a series of transport steps and non-movement intervals. A single value for a given size-class is not adequate to describe the critical conditions of entrainment under natural circumstances. A probability approach is much more suitable. The critical unit discharges (total discharge divided by active channel width) along the measuring reach are dependent on river bed morphology. In the steps bedload needs higher unit discharges to be entrained. Once entrained, the transport of bedload is stochastic in nature and the single particle transport is controlled by the step lengths and the duration of rest periods. The distributions of both parameters can be approximated by exponential functions. Applying the stochastic concept proposed by Einstein the mean values of the random variables [step length] and [duration of rest period] measured with the PETSY technique were used for the simulation of spatial distributions of bedload particles from point sources. More field and laboratory data are needed to include varying flow and roughness conditions with tracers representing different particle characteristics.},

This apparent decrease in sediment deposition has been attributed to completeness of the sedimentary record; the effect arises because of incorporation of longer hiatuses in deposition as averaging time is increased. We demonstrate that a heavy-tailed distribution of periods of nondeposition (hiatuses) produces this phenomenon and that observed accumulation rate decreases as t!!e!!1, over multiple orders of magnitude, where 0 < !!e!! !!e!! 1 is the parameter describing the tail of the distribution of quiescent period length. By using continuous time random walks and limit theory, we can estimate the actual average deposition rate from observations of the surface location over time. If geologic and geometric constraints place an upper limit on the length of hiatuses, then average accumulation rates approach a constant value at very long times. Our model suggests an alternative explanation for the apparent increase in global sediment accumulation rates over the last 5 million years.},

  abstract = {Characterizing the collective behavior of particle transport on the Earth surface is a key ingredient in describing landscape evolution. We seek equations that capture essential features of transport of an ensemble of particles on hillslopes, valleys, river channels, or river networks, such as mass conservation, superdiffusive spreading in flow fields with large velocity variation, or retardation due to particle trapping. Development of stochastic partial differential equations such as the advection-dispersion equation (ADE) begins with assumptions about the random behavior of a single particle: possible velocities it may experience in a flow field and the length of time it may be immobilized. When assumptions underlying the ADE are relaxed, a fractional ADE (fADE) can arise, with a non-integer-order derivative on time or space terms. Fractional ADEs are nonlocal; they describe transport affected by hydraulic conditions at a distance. Space fractional ADEs arise when velocity variations are heavy tailed and describe particle motion that accounts for variation in the flow field over the entire system. Time fractional ADEs arise as a result of power law particle residence time distributions and describe particle motion with memory in time. Here we present a phenomenological discussion of how particle transport behavior may be parsimoniously described by a fADE, consistent with evidence of superdiffusive and subdiffusive behavior in natural and experimental systems.},

  abstract = {Morphodynamics in sand-bed braided rivers are associated with simultaneous evolution of mid-channel bars and channels on the braidplain. Bifurcations around mid-channel bars are key elements that divide discharge and sediment. This, in turn, may control the evolution of connected branches, with effects propagating to both upstream and downstream bifurcations. Recent works on bifurcation stability and development hypothesize major roles of secondary flow and gradient advantage. However, this has not been tested for channel networks within a fully developed dynamic braided river. A reason for this is a lack of detailed measurements with sufficient temporal and spatial length, covering multiple bifurcations. Therefore we used a physics-based numerical model to generate a dataset of bathymetry, flow and sediment transport of an 80 km river reach with self-formed braid bars and bifurcations. The study shows that bar dissection due to local transverse water surface gradients is the dominant bifurcation initiation mechanism, although conversion of unit bars into compound bars dominates in the initial stage of a braided river. Several bifurcation closure mechanisms are equally important. Furthermore, the study showed that nodal point relations for bifurcations are unable to predict short-term bifurcation evolution in a braided river. This is explained by occurrence of nonlinear processes and non-uniformity within the branches, in particular migrating bars and larger-scale backwater-effects, which are not included in the nodal point relations. Planform morphology, on the other hand, has predictive capacity: bifurcation angle asymmetry and bar-tail limb shape are indicators for near-future bifurcation evolution. Remote sensing data has predictive value, for which we developed a conceptual model for interactions between bars, bifurcations and channels in the network. We conducted a preliminary test of the conceptual model on satellite images of the Brahmaputra. Copyright !!e!! 2015!!e!!John Wiley  \&  Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract  = {The Bagnold hypothesis has been a major tool in the development of mechanistic models of bed load transport. According to the hypothesis, a necessary constraint for the maintenance of equilibrium bed load transport is that the fluid shear stress at the bed must be reduced to the critical, or threshold value associated with incipient motion of grains. The constraint determines a functional form for the areal concentration of bed load grains as a function of flow parameters. It is shown here, however, that the Bagnold hypothesis breaks down when applied to equilibrium bed load transport on beds with transverse slopes above a relatively modest value that is well below the angle of repose. In particular, under such conditions it is shown that no areal concentration, no matter how large, is sufficient to reduce the fluid shear stress at the bed to the critical value. This failure motivates the abandonment of the Bagnold constraint, even for nearly horizontal beds. The framework presented here, however, provides a natural basis for an entrainment-based model of sediment transport that neither satisfies nor suffers from the drawbacks of the Bagnold constraint.},

abstract =  {This monograph presents results of the analytical and numerical modeling of convective heat and mass transfer in different rotating flows caused by (i) system rotation, (ii) swirl flows due to swirl generators, and (iii) surface curvature in turns and bends. Volume forces (i.e. centrifugal and Coriolis forces), which influence the flow pattern, emerge in all of these rotating flows. The main part of this work deals with rotating flows caused by system rotation, which includes several rotating-disk configurations and straight pipes rotating about a parallel axis. Swirl flows are studied in some of the configurations mentioned above. Curvilinear flows are investigated in different geometries of two-pass ribbed and smooth channels with 180° bends. The author demonstrates that the complex phenomena of fluid flow and convective heat transfer in rotating flows can be successfully simulated using not only the universal CFD methodology, but in certain cases by means of the integral methods, self-similar and analytical solutions. The book will be a valuable read for research experts and practitioners in the field of heat and mass transfer.},

  abstract = {This work presents recent advances on morphodynamic modeling of bed forms under unsteady discharge. This paper includes further development of a morphodynamic model proposed earlier by Giri and Shimizu (2006a). This model reproduces the temporal development of river dunes and accurately replicates the physical properties associated with bed form evolution. Model results appear to provide accurate predictions of bed form geometry and form drag over bed forms for arbitrary steady flows. However, accurate predictions of temporal changes of form drag are key to the prediction of stage-discharge relation during flood events. Herein, the model capability is extended to replicate the duneâ€“flat bed transition, and in turn, the variation of form drag produced by the temporal growth or decay of bed forms under unsteady flow conditions. Some numerical experiments are performed to analyze hysteresis of the stage-discharge relationship caused by the transition between dune and flat bed regimes during rising and falling stages of varying flows. The numerical model successfully simulates duneâ€“flat bed transition and the associated hysteresis of the stage-discharge relationship; this is in good agreement with physical observations but has been treated in the past only using empirical methods. A hypothetical relationship for a sediment parameter (the mean step length) is proposed to a first level of approximation that enables reproduction of the duneâ€“flat bed transition. The proposed numerical model demonstrates its ability to address an important practical problem associated with bed form evolution and flow resistance in varying flows.},

  abstract  = {Over the past 10 years the Rosgen classification system and its associated methods of "natural channel design" have become synonymous (to many without prior knowledge of the field) with the term "stream restoration" and the science of fluvial geomorphology. Since the mid 1990s, this classification approach has become widely, and perhaps dominantly adopted by governmental agencies, particularly those funding restoration projects. For example, in a request for proposals for the restoration of Trout Creek in Montana, the Natural Resources Conservation Service required "experience in the use and application of a stream classification system and its implementation." Similarly, classification systems have been used in evaluation guides for riparian areas and U.S. Forest Service management plans. Most notably, many highly trained geomorphologists and hydraulic engineers are often held suspect, or even thought incorrect, if their approach does not include reference to or application of a classification system. This, combined with the para-professional training provided by some involved in "natural channel design" empower individuals and groups with limited backgrounds in stream and watershed sciences to engineer wholesale re-patterning of stream reaches using 50-year old technology that was never intended for engineering design. At Level I, the Rosgen classification system consists of eight or nine major stream types, based on hydraulic-geometry relations and four other measures of channel shape to distinguish the dimensions of alluvial stream channels as a function of the bankfull stage. Six classes of the particle size of the boundary sediments are used to further sub-divide each of the major stream types, resulting in 48 or 54 stream types. Aside from the difficulty in identifying bankfull stage, particularly in incising channels, and the issue of sampling from two distinct populations (beds and banks) to classify the boundary sediments, the classification provides a consistent and reproducible means for practitioners to describe channel morphology although difficulties have been encountered in lower-gradient stream systems.

  abstract = {Abstract:â€‚ Over the past 10â€ƒyears the Rosgen classification system and its associated methods of â€œnatural channel designâ€� have become synonymous to some with the term â€œstream restorationâ€� and the science of fluvial geomorphology. Since the mid 1990s, this classification approach has become widely adopted by governmental agencies, particularly those funding restoration projects. The purposes of this article are to present a critical review, highlight inconsistencies and identify technical problems of Rosgenâ€™s â€œnatural channel designâ€� approach to stream restoration. This paperâ€™s primary thesis is that alluvial streams are open systems that adjust to altered inputs of energy and materials, and that a form-based system largely ignores this critical component. Problems with the use of the classification are encountered with identifying bankfull dimensions, particularly in incising channels and with the mixing of bed and bank sediment into a single population. Its use for engineering design and restoration may be flawed by ignoring some processes governed by force and resistance, and the imbalance between sediment supply and transporting power in unstable systems. An example of how C5 channels composed of different bank sediments adjust differently and to different equilibrium morphologies in response to an identical disturbance is shown. This contradicts the fundamental underpinning of â€œnatural channel designâ€� and the â€œreference-reach approach.â€� The Rosgen classification is probably best applied as a communication tool to describe channel form but, in combination with â€œnatural channel designâ€� techniques, are not diagnostic of how to mitigate channel instability or predict equilibrium morphologies. For this, physically based, mechanistic approaches that rely on quantifying the driving and resisting forces that control active processes and ultimate channel morphology are better suited as the physics of erosion, transport, and deposition are the same regardless of the hydro-physiographic province or stream type because of the uniformity of physical laws.},

  abstract = {Understanding bed load transport fluctuations in rivers is crucial for development of a transport theory and for choosing a sampling interval for â€œmeanâ€� transport rates. Field-scale studies lack sufficient resolution to statistically characterize these fluctuations, while laboratory experiments are limited in scale and hence cannot be directly compared to field cases. Here we use a natural-scale laboratory channel to examine bed load transport fluctuations in a heterogeneous gravel substrate under normal flow conditions. The novelty of our approach is the application of a geometrical/statistical formalism (called the multifractal formalism), which allows characterization of the â€œroughnessâ€� of the series (depicting the average strength of local abrupt fluctuations in the signal) and the â€œintermittencyâ€� (depicting the temporal heterogeneity of fluctuations of different strength). We document a rougher and more intermittent behavior in bed load sediment transport series at low-discharge conditions, transitioning to a smoother and less intermittent behavior at high-discharge conditions. We derive an expression for the dependence of the probability distribution of bed load sediment transport rates on sampling interval. Our findings are consistent with field observations demonstrating that mean bed load sediment transport rate decreases with sampling time at low-transport conditions and increases with sampling time at high-transport conditions. Simultaneous measurement of bed elevation suggests that the statistics of sediment transport fluctuations are related to the statistics of bed topography.},

The system of governing equations is hyperbolic and is expressed in nonconservative form. For this reason, fully primitive formulations of the model are often adopted for the solution, which however are known to incorrectly compute strength and celerity of shock waves (bores). In the present work a quasi-conservative formulation of the differential system is proposed, which aims at reducing these errors to a minimum. The performances of the model are assessed by comparison with primitive formulations applied to some schematic cases and with experimental observations obtained on a physical model of a river reach. Results are satisfactory and overcome predictions based on fully primitive formulations.},

  abstract = {We study the numerical approximation of the two-dimensional morphodynamic model governed by the shallow water and Exner equations to simulate reach-scale two-dimensional morphodynamics of bedload-dominated alluvial rivers. The solution strategy relies on a full coupling of the governing equations within each time step. The resulting system of governing equations contains nonconservative products related to the longitudinal and lateral bed slopes and source terms related to friction. The full problem is solved numerically on unstructured triangular grids, simultaneously updating the principal part and adding the source terms (friction) using a splitting technique. The principal part is solved by means of a novel second-order accurate upwind-biased centred scheme of the finite volume type, while the source terms are added to the problem by solving a system of ordinary differential equations. A new algorithm for treating the wetting-and-drying is also proposed. The model is applied to well-established test problems in order to verify the accuracy of the proposed method, the robustness of the wetting-and-drying algorithm and the ability of the model in dealing with transcritical flows. Finally we test the model ability to reproduce two dimensional morphodynamic processes occurring at the scale of tens of channel widths in bedload dominated alluvial rivers with homogeneous grain size. This is achieved by comparing model outcomes with those of analytical theories and flume experiments on the same morphodynamic processes. These selected !!e!!benchmarks!!e!! include migrating free bars spontaneously developing in straight reaches, steady bars forced by abrupt river planform changes and the dynamics of channel bifurcations.},

Avulsions are primarily features of aggrading floodplains. Their recurrence interval varies widely among the few modern rivers for which such data exist, ranging from as low as 28 years for the Kosi River (India) to up to 1400 years for the Mississippi. Avulsions cause loss of life, property damage, destabilization of shipping and irrigation channels, and even coastal erosion as sediment is temporarily sequestered on the floodplain. They are also the main process that builds alluvial stratigraphy. Their causes remain relatively unknown, but stability analyses of bifurcating channels suggest that thresholds in the relative energy slope and Shields parameter of the bifurcating channel system are key factors.},

  abstract  = {An understanding of the mechanics of nonuniform flow is important in a variety of ecological and geophysical fluid mechanical problems. Moreover, the ability to predict local boundary shear stress on an uneven bed is essential in erosion and sediment transport problems. In order to elucidate the important fluid mechanical phenomena active over natural quasi-two-dimensional bed forms a series of detailed flow measurements were made above 60- to 100-m-long 1- to 3-m-high dunes in the Columbia River. In this paper, velocity profiles obtained by averaging these flow data along lines of constant distance above the riverbed are examined, and it is shown that they can be constructed from well-known uniform flow results used in conjunction with a hypothesis about the structure of internal boundary layers. This approach permits skin friction as well as total boundary shear stress, averaged over one wavelength of the bed form, to be determined from spatially averaged velocity profiles and, conversely, provides a mechanism whereby zero-order velocity profiles can be constructed for two-dimensional nonuniform channel flows. Corrections for changes in the bottom roughness parameter caused by bed load transport and for flow stratification induced by suspended load transport are derived and applied in order to make the results consistent with the measured spatially averaged shear stress field.},

Only in some cases are the computed stream profiles fit exactly by any one of the commonly supported mathematical function analogs to graded profile form-exponential, logarithmic, or power function, but in most cases any of these functions can provide a fit with a degree of error smaller than would be noted in treating field data. Profiles dominated by spatial change in fluid and sediment discharge are distinctly power functions, while profiles dominated by sediment size reduction are not necessarily exponential in form. Other important controls on profile shape are the degree of downstream width change in response to increasing discharge and the general range of sediment size. A dynamic model of a river's approach to grade indicates that disequilibrium river profiles closely approximate a graded profile shape even while the general slope is relatively high, and significant erosion remains to achieve equilibrium.},

We studied these two dispersion effects with a sheath flow capillary electrophoresis (CE)â€“ICP-MS interface. A numerical model was used to simulate advection diffusion processes in the CE-capillary and dispersion in the spray chamber. Experimental results of FI with this CEâ€“ICP-MS interface agree well with numerical modeling results. Dispersion due to laminar flow depends strongly on capillary diameter and analyte diffusion coefficient and to a lesser extent on laminar velocity and capillary length and typically amounts to one order of magnitude peak width increase. Three spray chambers of 5, 20 and 150ml dead volume showed an increase in band broadening and peak tailing with increasing dead volume. The use of standard Scott-type spray chambers (>90ml volume) increases peak widths by 5â€“10s regardless of injection time. The use of a low dead volume spray chamber is recommended for experiments where resolution is critical. The modeling approach can be extended to the coupling of other flow injection techniques, like micro-LC and nano-LC with ICP-MS.},

To illustrate the ability of numerical models to provide a valuable tool for flood management planners, an exâ€�post analysis of the Rhine during the 19th century is carried out. The Upper German Rhine has been reshaped deeply by large engineering works over this century. The initially braided reach Baselâ€“Maxau was constricted into a single channel, while the reach Maxauâ€“Mainz was significantly shortened by meander shortcuts. Both types of works resulted in intense erosion upstream and spread deposition downstream, with most of the changes occurring during highâ€�flow periods. As ancient data are generally difficult to obtain, the paper shows how fragmentary ancient data may be complemented with more recent data adequately interpreted for reconstructing a realistic set of initial conditions. The study is an attempt at reproducing qualitatively the behaviour of the Upper Rhine with a dataset collected only from publicly available sources.},

Our solution procedure originates from the fully-unsteady matrix-vector formulation developed in [54]. The principal part of the problem is solved by an explicit Finite Volume upwind method of the path-conservative type, by which all the variables are updated simultaneously in a coupled fashion. The solution to the principal part is embedded into a splitting procedure for the treatment of frictional source terms. The numerical scheme is extended to second-order accuracy and includes a bookkeeping procedure for handling the evolution of size stratification in the substrate. We develop a concept of balancedness for the vertical mass flux between the substrate and active layer under bed degradation, which prevents the occurrence of non-physical oscillations in the grainsize distribution of the substrate. We suitably modify the numerical scheme to respect this principle. We finally verify the accuracy in our solution to the equations, and its ability to reproduce one-dimensional morphodynamics due to streamwise and vertical sorting, using three test cases. In detail, (i) we empirically assess the balancedness of vertical mass fluxes under degradation; (ii) we study the convergence to the analytical linearised solution for the propagation of infinitesimal-amplitude waves [54], which is here employed for the first time to assess a mixed-sediment model; (iii) we reproduce Ribberink!!e!!s E8-E9 flume experiment [46].},

To avoid the complexity of analyzing two-dimensional model results arising from the non-linear interaction between flow, fluvial transport and bank erosion, we develop a simplified framework. In detail, we reduce the two-dimensional morphodynamic model to a cross-sectional model under the assumption of longitudinal morphodynamic equilibrium, and apply bank erosion algorithms therein. To build candidate bank erosion models, we break down bank erosion algorithms into three modeling steps: identification of the bank, computation of sediment fluxes due to bank erosion, and bank updating. Different potential models are created by choosing different options for each step. We assess model performance against surveyed bank erosion over a flood event in the transitional Selwyn River, New Zealand. This study is preliminary to implementation of bank erosion in a fully two-dimensional setting, to model braided planform dynamics.},

  abstract  = {Avulsion parameters greatly influence alluvial architecture, because they determine channel density and interconnectedness. Reliable data on avulsion parameters is still scarce. From a detailed reconstruction of the Holocene avulsion history of the whole Rhine-Meuse delta we determined quantitative values for the avulsion parameters: avulsion frequency, avulsion duration, and interavulsion period. In the Rhine-Meuse delta the number of coeval channels is related to the avulsion frequency. Calibrated 14C intensity histograms are used to analyze 14C dates of beginning and ending river activity. The histograms show that instantaneous and gradual avulsions were almost equally important in the Rhine-Meuse delta. A high avulsion frequency occurred from 8000 to 7300 cal yr BP (a total of 17 avulsions, i.e., 2.43 avulsions/100 years). During this period the avulsion frequency was related to the high rate of sea-level rise, which induced fluvial sedimentation in the present near-coastal area. After 7300 cal yr BP avulsion frequency decreased as a result of a continuously decreasing rate of sea-level rise. From 7300 to 3200 cal yr BP avulsion frequency was low; 35 avulsions took place within 4100 years (0.85 avulsions/100 years). Approximately 5000 cal yr BP the coastal barriers became closed and large-scale peat formation occurred. This resulted in fixation of the river channels and low cross-valley gradients, reducing the chances for avulsion. Between 3200 and 1400 cal yr BP avulsion frequency was high again (a total of 34 avulsions, i.e., 1.89 avulsions/100 years) as a result of increased discharge and/or within-channel sedimentation, which enhanced chances for avulsion. The period of activity of channel belts shows no significant trend on the time scale of the Holocene. It is highly variable and averages 1280 {\textpm} 820 cal yr. The avulsion duration fluctuates between less than 200 and 1250 cal years and averages 335 cal years. The avulsion duration shows no significant trend through time and remained constant until at least 1900 cal yr BP. Avulsion duration seems not to be influenced by aggradation rate. Average interavulsion period is shorter than the period of activity of channel belts, and is approximately 945 cal years. In the Rhine-Meuse delta, on the time scale of the Holocene, interavulsion period and avulsion duration are on average constant. Therefore, the number of coeval channels is directly related to avulsion frequency. Available evidence from other rivers and deltas around the world, however, suggests that the relationship between these avulsion parameters is not everywhere the same.},

  abstract = {Recent research activities at the Delft Hydraulics Laboratory and the Delft University of Technology have increased the understanding of the large-scale bed deformation in alluvial rivers with relatively stable banks. In this paper the most important results of these activities are given. First bed deformation in river bends is explained in the light of the results of some laboratory experiments in curved flumes with fixed banks. The deformation is then explained in terms of wave length and damping with a linear analysis of the water and sediment motion for the steady state. From this analysis the conclusion is drawn that the point bar height and pool depth in bends cannot be predicted solely from local conditions. A significant part of the lateral bed slope is due to an overshoot effect induced by the redistribution of the water and sediment motion in the first part of the bend. Finally the results of computations with a non-linear two-dimensional model, simulating three curved flume experiments, are discussed. The simulations of the experiments are in fair agreement with the data measured.},

  abstract  = {The study analyses the morphological response of a gravel-bed river to discharges of different magnitude (from moderate events that occur several times a year to a 12-year flood) and so defines the range of formative discharges for single morphological units (channels, bars, islands) and a range of magnitude of morphological activity from the threshold discharges for gravel transport and minor bar modification up to flows causing major morphological changes.The study was conducted on the Tagliamento River, a large gravel-bed river in north-eastern Italy, using two different methods, analysis of aerial photographs and field observation of painted gravel particles. The available photographs (five flights from August 1997 to November 2002) and the two commissioned flights (June 2006 and April 2007) do not define periods with a single flood event, but the intervals are short enough (11 to 22 months) to have a limited number of flood events in each case. The fieldwork, which involved cross-section survey, grain-size analysis and observation of painted sediments, complemented the aerial surveys by allowing analysis of channel response to single flood events.Substantial morphological changes (e.g. bank erosion of several tens of metres up to more than 100!!e!!m) associated with flood events with a recurrence interval between 1!!e!!1 year and 12 years have been documented. Multiple forming discharges were defined based on the activity of different morphological units. Discharges equal to 20!!e!!50% of the bankfull discharge are formative for the channels, whereas the bankfull discharge (1!!e!!1 year flood in this case of the Tagliamento River) is formative for low bars. Larger floods, but still relatively frequent (with a recurrence interval less than five years), are required for full gravel transport on high bars and significant morphological changes of islands.

  abstract =  {This study combines mathematical modelling and supporting flume experiments to address the problem of how coastal plain rivers respond to a steady fall in relative sea-level. The theoretical component of the study focuses on the development of a moving boundary model of fluviodeltaic progradation that treats rigorously the dynamics of the shoreline and alluvial basement transition (the upstream limit of the alluvial river system). Dimensional analysis and numerical solutions to the model governing equations together suggest that, at first order, coastal plain rivers will remain aggradational on a timescale that varies with allogenic sediment and water supply and the fall rate of relative sea-level. In natural fluviodeltaic systems, this intrinsic timescale is likely to vary by several orders of magnitude, suggesting that the aggradational phase of river response can be geologically long-lived. At second order, the duration of alluvial aggradation is controlled by two dimensionless numbers that embody system geometry and the kinematics of alluvial sediment transport. Model predictions were tested in a series of carefully scaled flume experiments. The level of agreement between predicted and measured trajectories for the shoreline and alluvialâ€“basement transition strongly suggests that the moving boundary theory developed here successfully captures the response of small-scale fluviodeltaic systems to falling sea-level. The results of this study have several sequence-stratigraphic implications: a fall in relative sea-level at the shoreline is not a sufficient condition for river incision; the onset of alluvial degradation and sequence-boundary formation need not coincide with a maximum in the rate of sea-level fall; and the onset of sequence-boundary formation is sensitive to allogenic sediment supply.},

Long-term time-averaged values of discharge, suspended load, flow duration, flow peakedness, and temporally averaged values of precipitation, temperature, and range in temperature were coupled with the drainage area and basin relief to establish statistical relationships with the sediment rating parameters for 59 gauging stations. Rating parameters (a and b) are defined by a power law relating daily discharge values of a river (Q) and its sediment concentration Cs, where Cs = aQb. The rating coefficient a (the mathematical concentration at Q = 1 m3/s) is inversely proportional to the long-term mean discharge and is secondarily related to the average air temperature and the basin's topographic relief. The rating exponent b (the log-log slope of the power law) correlates most strongly with the average air temperature and basin relief and has lesser correlations with the long-term load of the river (which is related to basin relief and drainage area). The rating equation describes the long-term character of the suspended sediment load in a river. Each river undergoes higher-frequency variability (decadal, interannual, and storm event) around this characteristic response, controlled by weather patterns and channel recovery from extreme precipitation events.},

Humans have simultaneously increased the sediment transport by global rivers through soil erosion (by 2.3 {\textpm} 0.6 billion metric tons per year), yet reduced the flux of sediment reaching the world{\textquoteright}s coasts (by 1.4 {\textpm} 0.3 billion metric tons per year) because of retention within reservoirs. Over 100 billion metric tons of sediment and 1 to 3 billion metric tons of carbon are now sequestered in reservoirs constructed largely within the past 50 years. African and Asian rivers carry a greatly reduced sediment load; Indonesian rivers deliver much more sediment to coastal areas.},

  abstract  = {A series of laboratory experiments demonstrates that riparian vegetation can cause a braided channel to self-organize to, and maintain, a dynamic, single-thread channel. The initial condition for the experiments was steady-state braiding in non-cohesive sand under uniform discharge. From here, an experiment consisted of repeated cycles alternating a short duration high flow with a long duration low flow, and uniform dispersal of alfalfa seeds over the bed at the end of each high flow. Plants established on freshly deposited bars and areas of braidplain that were unoccupied during low flow. The presence of the plants had the effect of progressively focusing the high flow so that a single dominant channel developed. The single-thread channel self-adjusted to carry the high flow. Vegetation also slowed the rate of bank erosion. Matching of deposition along the point bar with erosion along the outer bend enabled the channel to develop sinuosity and migrate laterally while suppressing channel splitting and the creation of new channel width. The experimental channels spontaneously reproduced many of the mechanisms by which natural meandering channels migrate and maintain a single dominant channel, in particular bend growth and channel cutoff. In contrast with the braided system, where channel switching is a nearly continuous process, vegetation maintained a coherent channel until wholesale diversion of flow via cutoff and/or avulsion occurred, by which point the previous channel tended to be highly unfavorable for flow. Thus vegetation discouraged the coexistence of multiple channels. Varying discharge was key to allowing expression of feedbacks between the plants and the flow and promoting the transition from braiding to a single-thread channel that was then dynamically maintained.

Experiments were conducted in a physical model of channel bifurcation to estimate the coefficient and exponent of the nodal point relation for different nose angles and upstream discharges. It was found that the nose angle is the major variable for the distribution of sediments to the downstream branches. The value of the exponent k found from experimental results was compared with that of a theoretical analysis. For a stable equilibrium, the value of k is greater than 5!!e!!3 from theoretical consideration when the Engelund!!e!!Hansen sediment transport formula is used. This was confirmed from the experimental results. This suggests that the distribution of sediments at channel bifurcation can be expressed by the general nodal point relation.},

In particular, requirements of accuracy and stability for medium and long term simulations are difficult to meet. In this work, the derivation, design, and implementation of a discontinuous Galerkin finite element method (DGFEM) for sediment transport and bed evolution equations are presented. Numerical morphodynamic models involve a coupling between a hydrodynamic flow solver which acts as a driving force and a bed evolution model which accounts for sediment flux and bathymetry changes. A space \{DGFEM\} is presented based on an extended approach for systems of partial differential equations with non-conservative products, in combination with two intertwined Runge!!e!!Kutta time stepping schemes for the fast hydrodynamic and slow morphodynamic components. The resulting numerical scheme is verified by comparing simulations against (semi-)analytical solutions. These include the evolution of an initially symmetric, isolated bedform; the formation and propagation of a step in a straight channel due to a sudden overload of sediment discharge; the propagation of a travelling diffusive sediment wave in a straight channel; and, the evolution of an initially flat bed in a channel with a contraction. Finally, a comparison is made between a numerical simulation and field data of a trench excavated in the main channel of the Paran!!e!! river near Paran!!e!! city, Argentina.},

The most common anthropic cause is the construction of dams, which often reduces both the discharge regime and sediment transport, producing a narrowing and degradation of the river bed. In this study we propose a simple, lumped morphodynamic model that describes fluvial cross-section dynamics consequent to changes in discharge and sediment transport induced by external factors. The model provides the temporal dynamics of the river width and bed quote. These dynamics result not to be trivial and can exhibit non monotonic behavior, with aggradations and degradations, and narrowing and widening. The model has been tested on real rivers using data obtained from field studies. The agreement between the outcomes and the data measured in the field works is always satisfactory.},

  abstract  = {Recent research has examined the factors controlling the geometrical configuration of bifurcations, determined the range of stability conditions for a number of bifurcation types and assessed the impact of perturbations on bifurcation evolution. However, the flow division process and the parameters that influence flow and sediment partitioning are still poorly characterized. To identify and isolate these parameters, three-dimensional velocities were measured at 11 cross-sections in a fixed-walled experimental bifurcation. Water surface gradients were controlled, and systematically varied, using a weir in each distributary.As may be expected, the steepest distributary conveyed the most discharge (was dominant) while the mildest distributary conveyed the least discharge (was subordinate). A zone of water surface super-elevation was co-located with the bifurcation in symmetric cases or displaced into the subordinate branch in asymmetric cases. Downstream of a relatively acute-angled bifurcation, primary velocity cores were near to the water surface and against the inner banks, with near-bed zones of lower primary velocity at the outer banks. Downstream of an obtuse-angled bifurcation, velocity cores were initially at the outer banks, with near-bed zones of lower velocities at the inner banks, but patterns soon reverted to match the acute-angled case. A single secondary flow cell was generated in each distributary, with water flowing inwards at the water surface and outwards at the bed. Circulation was relatively enhanced within the subordinate branch, which may help explain why subordinate distributaries remain open, may play a role in determining the size of commonly-observed topographic features, and may thus exert some control on the stability of asymmetric bifurcations. Further, because larger values of circulation result from larger gradient disadvantages, the length of confluence!!e!!diffluence units in braided rivers or between diffluences within delta distributary networks may vary depending upon flow structures inherited from upstream and whether, and how, they are fed by dominant or subordinate distributaries.

  abstract  = {Equilibrium is a single word that embraces multiple concepts. The largely qualitative use of equilibrium within geomorphology has fostered imprecision and even outright error; as a result the term, for many, has degenerated to the status of a non-corrigible regulative principle. Although a few geomorphologists make precise use of equilibria terminology, their precision is invariably lost on the larger audience.Equilibrium is associated with force in dynamics, with energy in thermodynamics (and probability by extension), and with pure numerical behavior in mathematics. In General System Theory, equilibrium is derived from thermodynamics but applied, by analogy, almost exclusively to mass. In addition, a purely geomorphic version of equilibrium (dynamic equilibrium) stems from the work of G. K. Gilbert (1876; 1877) and is based on sediment flux at the basin scale. Unfortunately, Gilbert's concept/term has been distorted by some geomorphologists in their attempt to establish linkage between equilibria concepts, especially between those relating to energy and mass.This paper reviews and reconsiders the various equilibria concepts. An updated version of Gilbert's dynamic equilibrium based on sediment transfer proposed by Ahnert (n.d.), and termed by us �mass flux equilibrium,� holds promise. In addition, the purely mathematical concept of equilibrium outlined by Howard (1988) has considerable utility, provided union with geomorphological theory is achieved. Given the difficulty of measuring thermal energy in the field, its inefficient use in nature, and the uncertainty with which it and form can be related, thermodynamic equilibria concepts would appear, presently, to offer geomorphologists only very limited opportunities.},

  abstract = {A second-order accurate scheme based on high-resolution shock-capturing methods was used with a typical two-phase flow model which is used in the computer codes for simulation of nuclear power plant accidents. The two-fluid model, which has been taken from the computer code RELAP5, consists of six first-order partial differential equations that represent 1D mass, momentum, and energy balances for vapour and liquid. The partial differential equations are ill-posedâ€”nonhyperbolic. The hyperbolicity required by the presented numerical scheme was obtained in the practical range of the physical parameters by minor modification of the virtual mass term. No conservative form of the applied equations exists, therefore, instead of the Riemann solver, more basic averaging was used for the evaluation of the Jacobian matrix. The equations were solved using nonconservative and conservative basic variables. Since the source terms are stiff, they were integrated with time steps which were shorter than or equal to the convection time step. The sources were treated with Strang splitting to retain the second-order accuracy of the scheme. The numerical scheme has been used for the simulations of the two-phase shock tube problem and the Edwards pipe experiment. Results show the importance of the closure laws which have a crucial impact on the accuracy of two-fluid models. Advantages of the second-order accurate schemes are evident especially in the area of fast transients dominated by acoustic phenomena.},

In this study, accurate measurements in fully developed compound openâ€�channel flows are conducted by means of a fiberâ€�optic laser Doppler anemometer (FLDA). Secondary velocities can be measured very accurately with the present 3â€�D measurement system. The characteristics of compound openâ€�channel flows are recognized in the junction region between the main channel and flood plain, whereas the characteristics of rectangular openâ€�channel flows are observed in a region near the sidewall of the main channel. Strong, inclined secondary currents, which are associated with a pair of longitudinal vortices, are generated in the junction region between the main channel and the flood plain. The primary mean velocity field is directly influenced by these secondary currents. Turbulence intensities and the Reynolds stresses are also revealed in detail. Moreover, the effects of channel geometry and bed roughness on turbulent structure are examined.},

An empirical closure based on channel slope, bankfull channel depth, and median grain size is proposed and results in the scaling of bankfull Shields stress with the inverse square root of particle Reynolds number. The empirical relationship is sufficient for purposes of quantifying paleohydraulic conditions in ancient alluvial channels. However, it is not currently appropriate for application to alluvial channels on extraterrestrial bodies because it depends on constant-valued, Earth-based coefficients.},

  abstract  = {AbstractThe theoretical study of time-varying two-phase flow problems in several space dimensions introduces such a complicated set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations that numerical solution procedures for a high-speed computer are required in almost all but the simplest examples. Efficient attainment of realistic solutions for practical problems requires a finite difference formulation that is simultaneously implicit in the treatment of mass convection, equations-of-state, and the momentum coupling between phases. We describe such a method, discuss the equations on which it is based, and illustrate its properties by means of examples. In particular, we emphasize the capability for calculating physical instabilities and other time-varying dynamics, at the same time avoiding numerical instability. The computer code is applicable to problems in reactor safety analysis, the dynamics of fluidized dust beds, raindrops or aerosol transport, and a variety of similar circumstances, including the effects of phase transitions and the release of latent heat or chemical energy.},

High-definition submersed video cameras were utilized to record images of particle motion over a dune's length scale. Image processing was conducted to account for illumination heterogeneity due to bedform geometric irregularity and light reflection at the water's surface. Identification of moving particles using a customized algorithm was subsequently conducted and then the instantaneous velocity distribution of sediment particles was evaluated using particle image velocimetry. Obtained experimental results indicate that the motion of sediment particles atop dunes differs depending on dune geometry (i.e., two-dimensional or three-dimensional, respectively). Sediment motion and its relationship to dune shape and dynamics are also discussed.},

  abstract =  {In the present paper we provide an overview on some recent experimental and theoretical works, which have been specifically designed to analyze the behaviour of bifurcations in gravel-bed streams. We first investigate the occurrence of a bifurcation starting from an initially straight channel: the interaction between bed and banks evolution determines flow bifurcation when channel width oscillations reach a maximum amplitude; the process is strongly dependent on the migration speed of bars that form in the channel. Experimental evidence on the equilibrium configurations and stability of a simple Y-shaped bifurcation, both in the case of fixed and erodible-bank channels, shows that bifurcations are likely to display unbalanced configurations, characterized by uneven partition of flow discharge and different values of free surface width of downstream branches. Moreover bed levels of downstream branches differ, in accordance with field observations on gravel-bed rivers. Theoretical predictors based on 1D schemes supplemented by suitable 2D information at the node satisfactorily replicate most of the observed features. When the channels joining at the node are free to evolve, the stability of bifurcations is controlled by the occurrence of migrating bars and by the adaptation processes of channel width and planform, as well by the morphodynamic influence of the bifurcation. The resulting evolution may also depend on the initial mechanism triggering flow bifurcation.},

  abstract = {A theoretical model is formulated to investigate the development of the amplitude of alternate bars in unsteady flows. The problem is tackled by means of a weakly nonlinear analysis developed in a neighborhood of the threshold conditions for bar formation. Bar response to unsteady flow is found to depend on a parameter  that is a measure of the ratio between the time scale of the basic flow and the time scale of bar growth. The present theory shows that if  is O(1), as often occurs in nature, flow unsteadiness affects the instantaneous growth rate and phase of bar perturbations and controls the final amplitude reached by the bed configuration. A procedure for determining the final amplitude for a given flood event is proposed. Flume experiments were performed to test the main theoretical results. The bed response to unsteady flow was measured for different values of the period of the flood. The observed temporal behavior of the bar amplitude proves to be strongly affected by the unsteady character of the flow for  of O(1), as predicted by the theory.},

  abstract =  {The partitioning of the total sediment load of a river into suspended load and bedload is an important problem in fluvial geomorphology, sedimentation engineering and sedimentology. Bedload transport rates are notoriously hard to measure and, at many sites, only suspended load data are available. Often the bedload fraction is estimated with !!e!!rule of thumb!!e!! methods such as Maddock!!e!!s Table, which are inadequately field-tested. Here, the partitioning of sediment load for the Pitzbach is discussed, an Austrian mountain stream for which high temporal resolution data on both bedload and suspended load are available. The available data show large scatter on all scales. The fraction of the total load transported in suspension may vary between zero and one at the Pitzbach, while its average decreases with rising discharge (i.e. bedload transport is more important during floods). Existing data on short-term and long-term partitioning is reviewed and an empirical equation to estimate bedload transport rates from measured suspended load transport rates is suggested. The partitioning averaged over a flood can vary strongly from event to event. Similar variations may occur in the year-to-year averages. Using published simultaneous short-term field measurements of bedload and suspended load transport rates, Maddock!!e!!s Table is reviewed and updated. Long-term average partitioning could be a function of the catchment geology, the fraction of the catchment covered by glaciers and the extent of forest, but the available data are insufficient to draw final conclusions. At a given drainage area, scatter is large, but the data show a minimal fraction of sediment transported in suspended load, which increases with increasing drainage area and with decreasing rock strength for gravel-bed rivers, whereby in large catchments the bedload fraction is insignificant at ca 1%. For sand-bed rivers, the bedload fraction may be substantial (30% to 50%) even for large catchments. However, available data are scarce and of varying quality. Long-term partitioning varies widely among catchments and the available data are currently not sufficient to discriminate control parameters effectively.},

In forecasting models, groyne fields are represented as dead zones with effective properties like exchange coefficients and exchanging volume. Despite its relevance for such practical applications, little research has been done on the exchange process between a groyne field and the main stream itself. Therefore, this study is aimed at examining this exchange process and validating the dead-zone prediction model, which treats the exchange process as a first order system. A schematized physical model of a river with groynes was built in a laboratory flume. The exchange process was visualized quantitatively with dye in adjacent groyne fields. In order to couple the exchange process to the velocity field, particle tracking velocimetry measurements were performed. Two different types of exchange were observed. First, exchange takes place via the mixing layer that is formed at the river-groyne-field interface. The large eddies formed in the mixing layer are the major cause of this exchange. Second, under certain conditions, even larger eddies are shed from the upstream groyne tip. Distortions in the flow field caused by such intermittent structures cause a much larger exchange than that by the mixing layer alone. The occurrence of large shed eddies depends on the presence of a sufficiently large, stationary, secondary gyre located at the upstream corner of the groyne field. The overall exchange of matter could be characterized as a first-order process, in accordance with the dead-zone-theory. The corresponding exchange coefficients agreed reasonably well with the results of earlier experiments and the effective coefficients as found in experiments in real river flows.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Complex flow processes at river bifurcations and the influence of the layout of a bifurcation make it difficult to predict sediment distribution over the downstream branches in case bedload transport dominates. In oneâ€�dimensional models we need a nodal point relationship that prescribes the distribution of sediment over the downstream branches. We have identified which factors need to be included in such a relationship for the division of bedload transport at bifurcations. Next, irrotational flow theory for idealized geometries has been used to derive a simple physicsâ€�based nodal point relationship that accounts for the effects of helical flow in the situation that a channel takes off under an angle from a straight main channel. This first step towards a complete nodal point relationship is applicable to bedload transport situations if the flow is clearly curved and if there is no pronounced bed topography. The relationship has been tested against data from a unique set of laboratory measurements, numerical data and data from a scale model of the Rhine bifurcation at Pannerden in the Netherlands. We find that the derived model yields a reasonable prediction of the sediment division over the downstream branches, and yields better predictions than the Wang et al. model for the situation considered. Considering the relative complexity and limited accuracy of the nodal point relationship for the effect of helical flow alone, however, we conclude thatderiving a practical physicsâ€�based 1â€�D relationship including all relevant processes is not feasible. We therefore recommend 2â€�D or 3â€�D modelling for all cases in general where morphological evolution depends on the division of bedload transport at bifurcations.

  abstract = {Chute cutoffs reduce sinuosity of meandering rivers and potentially cause a transition from a single to a multiple channel river. The channel bifurcation of the main channel and the mouth of the incipient chute channel controls sediment and flow partitioning and development of the chute. Recent channel bifurcation models suggest that upstream bend radius, gradient advantage, inlet step, and upstream sediment supply at the bifurcation are important factors in the evolution of bifurcations. Our objective is to unravel the relative importance of these factors for chute cutoff success and development. We compare results from a morphodynamic three-dimensional (3D) model and a one-dimensional (1D) model with nodal-point relation with field observations of chute cutoffs in a meandering gravel-bed river. The balance between increased gradient advantage and flow curvature upstream of the chute channel bifurcation was systematically investigated with the 1D model. The 3D model runs and the field observations show the development of two types of chute cutoffs: a scroll-slough cutoff and a bend cutoff. The morphodynamic 3D model demonstrates that chutes are initiated when flow depth exceeds the floodplain elevation. Overbank flow and a significant gradient advantage result in a bend cutoff. The outcome of the 1D model shows that channel curvature at the bifurcation determines the success or failure of the chute cutoff when the chute channel is located at the inner bend, as in the case of scroll-slough cutoffs. We conclude that chute initiation depends on floodplain characteristics, i.e., floodplain elevation, sediment composition, and the presence of vegetation. Chute cutoff success or failure is determined by the dynamics just upstream of the channel bifurcation and location of the chute channel in the bend, which determines channel curvature and gradient advantage. These findings have ramifications for the prediction of chute cutoff in a wide range of rivers under natural and managed conditions and for the understanding of stratigraphy and architecture of deposits.},

  booktitle = {RCEM},
  year =      {2011},
abstract =  {The bed of a river goes through various stages of development as the flow strength increases. Starting from a plane bed, first ripples will appear, followed by dunes, a transition stage and then an upper-stage plane bed (Richards, 1982). After these regimes the bed can evolve further, but for lowland rivers only the mentioned regimes are relevant. Dunes are the most common bedforms in lowland river channels consisting of sand and gravel. Dunes influence water levels significantly, because they impose roughness on the flow. In general, increasing bedform dimensions lead to increasing water levels. While there are various models that describe the interaction between flow, sediment and bed form properties well, there are few that are able to describe all the transitions from a lower-stage plane bed through an upper-stage plane bed. Also, there is a need for fast calculation of bedform evolution and the effects that they have on hydraulic roughness, in order to be useful for operational flood forecasting models (during floods bedforms develop rapidly). This means that certain physical processes will have to be left out or parameterized in a solid way, while preserving the essential characteristics and valid outcomes. The dune evolution model of Paarlberg et al. (2009) was specifically set up to fit this goal. It is a 2DV-model with only bed load transport and assumes constant eddy-viscosity. To predict the characteristic evolution of dunes, a parameterization of the flow separation zone was implemented. The model then was able to predict dune length and height well while remaining computationally cheap. However, this model is unable to predict a transition to an upper-stage plane bed, because there is no way for the sediment transport and shear stresses to be out of phase. Therefore another way to handle sediment transport is implemented, inspired by the model of Shimizu et al. (2009). In this paper a lag distance is introduced directly in the model of Paarlberg et al. (2009). The effects on bed morphologies and development characteristics of using this non-equilibrium transport relation versus the previous equilibrium transport relation are explored. In general dune heights become smaller than with the original model. Flow separation is suppressed and thereby dune height. Dune lengths become (much) larger, though for small lag distances the predicted dune lenght shows an improved agreement with the measured dune length. Water depths slightly decrease. The results show the potential of this way of modelling non-equilbrium bed load to be able to predict a transition to plane bed. In the future the model will be further refined by improving the relation between shear stress and the step-length of transported material. In this light experiments will be undertaken by the authors to better capture the processes that trigger the transition to an upper-stage plane bed. With this, the model will be validated further.},

These allow for the modeling of the spatial lag between the sediment transport rate and bed shear stress along dune surfaces. This lag is an important factor in determining transitions between bedform regimes. Results of the original dune model (using an equilibrium transport formula) are compared with (1)\&nbsp;a new model version that directly models spatial lag with a relaxation equation and (2)\&nbsp;a new model version including pick-up and deposition processes. Both bed-load models use mean particle step length as an important parameter, which is varied to assess which value is appropriate for the dune regime. Laboratory experiments are simulated with the model. This shows that the results are best with the pick-up and deposition model version, combined with a step length of 25 times the particle diameter. It is furthermore shown that in principle the model is also able to wash out fully grown dunes, by increasing the step length parameter.},

  abstract  = {ABSTRACT Quantitative evaluation of fluvial response to allogenic controls is crucial for further progress in understanding the stratigraphic record in terms of processes that control landscape evolution. For instance, without quantitative insight into time lags that are known to exist between sea-level change and fluvial response, there is no way to relate fluvial stratigraphy to the sea-level curve. It is difficult to put firm constraints on these time-lag relationships on the basis of empirical studies. Therefore, we have started to quantify time-averaged erosion and deposition in the fluvial and offshore realms in response to sea-level change by means of analogue modelling in a 4!!e!!8-m flume tank. The rate of sea-level change was chosen as an independent variable, with other factors such as sediment supply, discharge and initial geometry kept constant over the course of 18 experiments. Our experimental results support the common view that neither fall nor rise in sea level affects the upstream fluvial system instantaneously. An important cause for the delayed fluvial response is that a certain amount of time is required to connect initial incisions on the newly emergent shelf (canyons) with the fluvial valley. Lowering of the fluvial longitudinal profile starts only after the connection of an active shelf canyon with the fluvial valley; until that moment the profile remains steady. We quantified the process of connection and introduced the quantity !!e!!connection rate!!e!!. It controlled, in conjunction with the rate of sea-level fall: (1) the amount of fluvial degradation during sea-level fall; (2) the total sediment volume that bypasses the shelf edge; (3) the percentage of fluvial relative to shelf sediment in the lowstand delta; (4) the volume of the transgressive systems tract and (5) the amount of diachroneity along the sequence boundary. Our experiments demonstrate also that the sequence-stratigraphic concept is difficult to apply to continental successions, even when these successions have been deposited within the influence of sea level.},

The model domain ranges from the tidal boundary at Gent down to the Belgian coastal cities of Nieuwpoort and Zeebrugge. The hydrodynamic simulations on which the mud transport model is based show realistic values for water levels, salinities and residual currents in the major part of the model domain. However, the propagation of the tidal wave is modelled less accurately upstream of Antwerp. Regarding the mud transport simulations, which are based on simple process formulations, it is shown that a satisfactory agreement is obtained between computed and observed concentration levels and their spatial and temporal variations. SPM levels in the Scheldt appear to be rather sensitive to the volume of harbour siltation and dumping, notably near Antwerp. The sediment budget computed by the model includes an unrealistically high residual sediment flux towards the North Sea. By enhancing the estuarine mud circulation, the modelled residual flux becomes smaller and agrees better with observation-based estimates. A longer hydrodynamic simulation period (presently up to 3 months) would help to analyse the sediment budget and seasonal dynamics in more detail.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the application of a simple algorithm for the buffering of fines in a sandy seabed. A second layer is introduced in which fines may be stored during calm weather and from which fines may be resuspended during storms. The algorithm is applied first in a one-dimensional vertical (1DV) point model at a location in the North Sea, Noordwijk 10, 10km offshore. It is able to reproduce the observed temporal variability of suspended particulate matter satisfactorily. Apart from the second layer, also the applied first order erosion rate is an important element of the algorithm. This allows for an equilibrium sediment mass per unit area for any combination of bed shear stress climate and sediment supply. The classical Partheniadesâ€“Krone formulation with zero-order erosion (i.e. an erosion rate that is independent from the sediment mass per unit area) does not have such equilibrium. As a next step, the algorithm is incorporated into a 3D model for suspended particulate matter (SPM) transport in the Dutch coastal zone. It is demonstrated that the model is able to reproduce the observed spatial and temporal variability reasonably well. An essential feature of the 3D mud model is that it is sufficiently fast to compute equilibrium bed composition. This implies that the results are completely independent from the applied (uniform) initial conditions. Finally, the mud model is applied to assess the impact of a large-scale release of fines in the Dutch coastal zone. The computed impact turns out to be very sensitive to the assumed buffer capacity of the seabed. However, information on transient system response (such as the dissipation of a sediment pulse in the system) from which the buffer capacity may be estimated is most often lacking. For the time being, estimates on the residence time of fines in the seabed and its mixing depth are derived from the literature. Additional field and laboratory test on the exchange mechanisms of fines between the water column and a sandy seabed are recommended.},

  abstract = {The influence of sand and mud transport on the morphological behaviour of a short tidal basin is investigated in this paper. For this purpose, a morphological model is applied in which sand and mud transport are included and the temporal and spatial bed composition variations are taken into account. Initially, the morphological development shows a sand wave near the entrance of the basin and a mud deposition wave more landward. A quasi equilibrium bed level profile is found after a long period (order century) with a sandy bed surface over almost the entire basin and only a small muddy area near the landward end. The dimensionless ratio between the deposition and erosion flux turns out to be a crucial parameter for the understanding of the observed behaviour. Comparison with previous studies on short tidal basins for sand indicates only that the presence of mud in a combined sand mud model does not change the equilibrium bed level profile considerably for the applied parameter settings herein, but drastically decreases the morphological time scale. Comparison between model results and field data of the Wadden Sea suggests that the obtained bed level and bed composition profile are realistic, indicating that the process-based sand mud model is a first step towards a better understanding of sand mud distributions in tidal basins.},

  abstract = {The erosion behaviour of sandâ€“mud mixtures is not well understood. As a first step, a conceptual framework for the erosion behaviour of sandâ€“mud mixtures is proposed and validated with data from field and laboratory experiments based on appropriate parameters for cohesion and network structure. Six bed types with different characteristics are distinguished in relational diagrams. Validation with experimental data shows that observed transitions in erosion behaviour are clearly delimited in these diagrams. Mud content (%<0.063mm) as a descriptor for the transition between non-cohesive and cohesive erosion behaviour turns out to be less generic than the clay content (%<0.004mm). Furthermore, an estimation of the relevance of these compositional bed types in natural systems shows that the frequently observed constant ratio between clay and silt in the bed sediments of some depositional system strongly limits the number of relevant bed types in that system.},

  abstract =  {The linear formulation for erosion E = M(Ï„bâˆ’Ï„c), often applied in engineering applications, has two properties, which do not always comply with field and laboratory observations, they are as follows: (1) The erosion rate is zero below the critical bed shear stress Ï„c and increases linearly with bed shear stress Ï„b, when exceeding the critical bed shear stress; incipient motion (Ï„b â‰ƒ Ï„c) is poorly represented. (2) The erosion rate is constant in time for constant values of M and Ï„c, whereas observations often suggest time dependency. In this paper we analyze the process of incipient motion and time dependency by using a stochastic forcing (bed shear stress) and a stochastic bed strength (critical bed shear stress). It is well known that the bed shear stress is not constant but varies due to turbulence. This stochastic nature of the turbulent motion is accounted for by a probability density distribution for the bed shear stress, which is based on the formulation of Hofland and Battjes (2006). This distribution is implemented in the linear erosion formulation. An analytical solution for the erosion rate is obtained, which only depends on the mean bed shear stress. A parametrization is made for efficient application in numerical models. The sediment in the bed is considered to be nonuniform. Therefore, it is subdivided into several classes, distinguished by the critical bed shear stress and not necessarily by the grain size. The variability of the critical bed shear stress is treated in a discritized way. Sediment balance equations are solved for each class. Considering different classes, the total erosion rate becomes time dependent, as the erosion depends on the availability of sediment. The model is applied to two annular flume data sets, Jacobs (2009) and Amos et al. (1992a). The results show that with a proper choice of the required parameters, the time dependence of the erosion rate and the concentration can be reproduced. We conclude that the occurrence of incipient motion can be explained from a stochastic forcing. Time-varying erosion rates can be explained from a stochastic bed strength distribution or from a vertical gradient in bed strength. The latter is, however, not likely and not measurable in the top layers of dense consolidated cohesive sediment beds.},

  abstract  = {Abstract In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Rhine in the Netherlands has been heavily trained for the purpose of safe discharge of water, sediment and ice, and a better navigability. Currently a large number of new river intervention works are planned and built within the Room for the River Program (RfR) and the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). The measures increase the flood conveyance capacity as well as biodiversity. Popular measures are dike setback, lowering flood plains, reconnecting side channels and removal of bank defences. Improving conditions for inland navigation has not been a design criterion in these RfR and \{WFD\} projects. River intervention based on RfR and \{WFD\} design principles is not totally unique for the Netherlands. Examples can also be found elsewhere in the world, i.e. in China, in USA, in Colombia and elsewhere in Europe. River intervention works based on the RfR and \{WFD\} design principles turn out to have a strong impact on flow and sediment transport fields, and induce larger dynamics of the riverbed. This negatively influences the river's navigability. As a consequence maintenance costs for navigation are expected to rise. Moreover, the intended dredging operations will hamper inland navigation significantly, resulting in large economic impacts and a lower safety of inland navigation. This paper illustrates the potential of a stochastic approach to assess maintenance dredging and navigability, before and after execution RfR intervention works. A 2D morphological model is used in a deterministic and stochastic setting using Monte Carlo Simulation, and the merits of a stochastic approach with respect to a deterministic approach are illustrated. The authors give recommendations for river training works that could be jointly considered with RfR intervention works, in order to avoid excessive maintenance dredging and create a river system that keeps itself navigable: so self-supporting.},

  abstract = {Abstract The presence of vegetation modifies flow and sediment transport in alluvial channels and hence the morphological evolution of river systems. Plants increase the local roughness, modify flow patterns and provide additional drag, decreasing the bed-shear stress and enhancing local sediment deposition. For this, it is important to take into account the presence of vegetation in morphodynamic modelling. Models describing the effects of vegetation on water flow and sediment transport already exist, but comparative analyses and validations on extensive datasets are still lacking. In order to provide practical information for modelling purposes, we analysed the performance of a large number of models on flow resistance, vegetation drag, vertical velocity profiles and bed-shear stresses in vegetated channels. Their assessments and applicability ranges are derived by comparing their predictions with measured values from a large dataset for different types of submerged and emergent vegetation gathered from the literature. The work includes assessing the performance of the sediment transport capacity formulae of Engelund and Hansen and van Rijn in the case of vegetated beds, as well as the value of the drag coefficient to be used for different types of vegetation and hydraulic conditions. The results provide a unique comparative overview of existing models for the assessment of the effects of vegetation on morphodynamics, highlighting their performances and applicability ranges.

  abstract  = {ABSTRACTAlluvial rivers are shaped by sequences of water flows excavating their channels. Observations show that besides the magnitude, the frequency and duration of streamflow oscillations might also be important for the river channel formation. In addition, the river morphology appears influenced by both size and degree of uniformity of the sediment. Nevertheless, many morphodynamic studies still represent the flow regime with a single value of the discharge, often corresponding to the bankfull condition, and the sediment with its median grain size. This work investigates the effects of streamflow variability and sediment characteristics on channel width formation, analysing the evolution of experimental streams with different sediments and discharge hydrographs. Results show that the formative condition of the channel width is not the geometric bankfull flow but a rather frequent peak flow. Remarkably different channel configurations arise from different sediment characteristics in the laboratory, where sediment non-uniformity produces more stable banks.},

This paper investigates whether modeling of flow resistance caused by natural woody vegetation can be improved using explicit description of both the foliage and stem. For this purpose, we directly measured the drag forces of Alnus glutinosa, Betula pendula, Salix viminalis, and Salix x rubens twigs in a laboratory flume at four foliation levels, parameterized with the leaf-area-to-stem-area ratio AL/AS. The species differed in the foliage drag but had approximately equal stem drag. For the foliated twigs, increasing AL/AS was found to increase the reconfiguration and the share of the foliage drag to the total drag. The experiments provided new insight into the factors governing the flow resistance of natural woody vegetation and allowed us to develop a model for estimating the vegetative friction factor using the linear superposition of the foliage and stem drag. The model is novel in that the foliage and stem are separately described with physically based parameters: drag coefficients, reconfiguration parameters, and leaf area and frontal-projected stem area per ground area. The model could satisfactorily predict the flow resistance of twig to sapling-sized specimens of the investigated species at velocities of 0.05â€“1 m/s. As a further benefit, the model allows exploring the variability in drag and reconfiguration associated with differing abundance of the foliage in relation to the stem.},

In this context we compile and review the current contributions of numerical modelling to the understanding of fluvial archives. In particular, recent advances, current limitations, previous unexpected results and future perspectives are all discussed. Numerical modelling efforts have demonstrated that fluvial systems can display non-linear behaviour with often unexpected dynamics causing significant delay, amplification, attenuation or blurring of externally controlled signals in their simulated record. Numerical simulations have also demonstrated that fluvial records can be generated by intrinsic dynamics without any change in external controls. Many other model applications demonstrate that fluvial archives, specifically of large fluvial systems, can be convincingly simulated as a function of the interplay of (palaeo) landscape properties and extrinsic climate, base level and crustal controls. All discussed models can, after some calibration, produce believable matches with real world systems suggesting that equifinality - where a given end state can be reached through many different pathways starting from different initial conditions and physical assumptions - plays an important role in fluvial records and their modelling. The overall future challenge lies in the development of new methodologies for a more independent validation of system dynamics and research strategies that allow the separation of intrinsic and extrinsic record signals using combined fieldwork and modelling.},

  abstract = {As gravel-bedded rivers fine in the downstream direction, they characteristically exhibit an abrupt transition from gravel- to sand-bedded conditions. The prevailing theory for why abrupt gravel-sand transitions emerge is based on bed load sorting of a bimodal sediment. The abruptness is thought to be a consequence of sand overwhelming the gravel-sand mixture once it reaches a critical coverage on the bed. The role suspension plays in the development of gravel-sand transitions has not been fully appreciated. The Fraser River, British Columbia, is an archetypical abrupt gravel-sand transition with a diffuse extension composed of a sand bed with some patches of gravel. We examine flow, shear stress, and suspended sediment flux in the diffuse extension to better understand sediment dynamics where the sand bed emerges. Sand is carried in suspension upstream of the primary abrupt gravel-sand transition, but in the diffuse extension, sand is moved as both bed load and suspended load. We do not observe downstream gradients in shear stress or suspended sand flux through the diffuse extension that would suggest a gradual ain out of sand moving downstream, which raises the question, how is the sand bed formed? Sediment advection length scales indicate that with the exception of very fine sand that moves as wash load in the diffuse extension, fractions coarser than the median sand size cannot be carried in suspension for more than one channel width. This suggests that sand is deposited en masse at the beginning of the diffuse extension, forming a sediment slug at low flood flows that is smeared downstream at high flood flows to form the sand reach.},

  abstract = {Abstract Several decades of field observations, laboratory experiments and mathematical modelings have demonstrated that the riparian environment is a disturbance-driven ecosystem, and that the main source of disturbance is river flow fluctuations. The focus of the present work has been on the key role that flow fluctuations play in determining the abundance, zonation and species composition of patches of riparian vegetation. To this aim, the scientific literature on the subject, over the last 20 years, has been reviewed. First, the most relevant ecological, morphological and chemical mechanisms induced by river flow fluctuations are described from a process-based perspective. The role of flow variability is discussed for the processes that affect the recruitment of vegetation, the vegetation during its adult life, and the morphological and nutrient dynamics occurring in the riparian habitat. Particular emphasis has been given to studies that were aimed at quantifying the effect of these processes on vegetation, and at linking them to the statistical characteristics of the river hydrology. Second, the advances made, from a modeling point of view, have been considered and discussed. The main models that have been developed to describe the dynamics of riparian vegetation have been presented. Different modeling approaches have been compared, and the corresponding advantages and drawbacks have been pointed out. Finally, attention has been paid to identifying the processes considered by the models, and these processes have been compared with those that have actually been observed or measured in field/laboratory studies.},

  abstract  = {A new approach for the profiling of movable sediment beds in laboratory experiments is presented. It couples a triangulation laser sensor and an ultrasonic level transmitter, and allows a non-intrusive, fast and accurate measurement of bed topography without stopping the experimental runs. The distortion of the laser beam due to the refraction at the water surface is corrected by contemporaneously measuring the elevation of the water surface through the ultrasonic level transmitter and taking advantage of geometrical relations involving the water depth, distance of the sensors from the water surface, and the angles that the emitted laser beam forms with the vertical before and after refraction. Several tests, under either still- or flowing-water conditions, as well as increasing/decreasing water surface elevation, were carried out to evaluate the accuracy of the measurements. These tests indicate that good-quality measurements are obtained for flow depths in the range 0â€‰<â€‰Dâ€‰<â€‰60 mm, typical of morphodynamic laboratory experiments. Finally, two relevant applications to movable bed experiments carried out under either lagoonal or fluvial conditions are presented that show the effectiveness of the proposed profiling technique.

  abstract = {AbstractTravel distance and residence time probability distributions are the key components of stochastic models for coarse sediment transport. Residence time for individual grains is difficult to measure, and residence time distributions appropriate to field and laboratory settings are typically inferred theoretically or from overall transport characteristics. However, bed elevation time series collected using sonar transducers and lidar can be translated into empirical residence time distributions at each elevation in the bed and for the entire bed thickness. Sediment residence time at a given depth can be conceptualized as a stochastic return time process on a finite interval. Overall sediment residence time is an average of residence times at all depths weighted by the likelihood of deposition at each depth. Theory and experiment show that when tracers are seeded on the bed surface, power law residence time will be observed until a timescale set by the bed thickness and bed fluctuation statistics. After this time, the long-time (global) residence time distribution will take exponential form. Crossover time is the time of transition from power law to exponential behavior. The crossover time in flume studies can be on the order of seconds to minutes, while that in rivers can be days to years.},

Careful inspection reveals that this concept may not have been well defined, and different interpretations have led to conflicting representations. Because total load is ultimately the quantity of interest, we define a new index, the half-load discharge, which is that discharge above and below which half the total long-term load is transported. The value of the half-load discharge is derived for a reasonable model of flows and constituent concentration. The effective discharge has generally been thought to be a relatively common or frequent flood. The half-load discharge is generally a much greater and less frequent flow than commonly used estimators of the effective discharge. Relations provided here for the frequency and magnitude of the half-load discharge provide evidence that it is relatively rare floods that transport most of the sediment over the long term. These ideas apply to other constituents as well.},

  abstract = {Sediment replenishment by artificial gravel deposits is a measure to increase sediment supply in gravel-bed rivers. Thereby, streambank erosion is the dominant process for gravel entrainment. In this contribution, we quantitatively validate a numerical morphodynamic 2D model and the relevant model approaches to reproduce non-cohesive streambank erosion. Therefore, a calibration and a sensitivity analysis of the relevant model approaches and parameters are carried out based on a reference laboratory experiment on streambank erosion in a straight channel from the literature. The relevant model approaches identified to successfully reproduce lateral streambank erosion are the gravitational bank collapse, the lateral bed slope effect on the bed load transport direction and the local bed slope effect on the critical Shields stress. Based on these findings, the numerical model was compared against data from laboratory experiments on gravel deposit erosion. Thereby, the focus was on the influence of the hydraulic discharge, the grain size distribution of the sediment and the geometrical quantities of the gravel deposits, such as the width, height and length of the deposit. It is shown that the dynamics of the erosion process were well reproduced by the numerical model using non-uniform sediment. Furthermore, the erosion rates were in good agreement with the laboratory experiments, except for the initial phase of the experiments, where the erosion rates were highest and settling of the gravel deposit was observed in the laboratory experiments. Overall, the numerical model proved to be a suitable tool to predict the erosion process of artificial gravel deposits, and hence, can be recommended for the design of sediment replenishment measures.},

  abstract =    {The use of models for solving water quality and quantity problems is not restricted to mathematical modeIs, as other types also have their possibilities and drawbacks. Mathematical methods, however, have certain properties which make them particularly suitable for water management studies. The examples of mathematical models dealt with in this paper involve one or two spatial dimensions (in the horizontal plane) and time. Research on two-dimensional modeIs in the vertical plane and three-dimensional modeIs is not far advanced enough for them to be available for routine use. Quality parameters that do not affect the flow of water are the only ones considered in this paper. Methods of evaluating the effects of buoyancy and stratification are peing developed but are not yet operationaI. Situations which can be investigated by means of present-day mathematical models are: a. Flow of water and dispersion of heat or dissolved substances in canals or systems of canals (networks), either for steady or for unsteady flows, b. The same phenomena in shallow lakes, estuaries or seas characterized by twodimensional flow in the horizontal plane. One-dimensional flow models have been used to study water management in several networks of canals. The studies concern both design problems, such as the location and capacity of new pumping stations, and decision problems connected with the operation of a system of pumping stations and sluices. The one-dimensional technique has also been successfully applied to the Oosterschelde estuary, much of which consists of natural channels. Similar methods are being used to determine the distribution of flow in the major beds of river systems when designing dikes. In the latter type of computation the flow is assumed to be quasi-steady. Once the flow in channels or rivers is known, either from one-dimensional models as described above, or from other sources, the water quality can be studied by means of convection-dispersion equations for the transport of dissolved substances or heat. Examples are the cooling-water circuit of a power plant (steady flow), the quality of water in artificial or natural storage basins (unsteady flow, including tidal effects) and the distribution of waste water in estuaries (considering net-flow only; dispersion is taken to include tidal mixing). The coefficient of dispersion involved in these models depends very greatly on the schematization and is empiricaI.},

  abstract = {Abstract The notion of sedimentâ€�transport capacity has been engrained in geomorphological and related literature for over 50â€‰years, although its earliest roots date back explicitly to Gilbert in fluvial geomorphology in the 1870s and implicitly to eighteenth to nineteenth century developments in engineering. Despite cross fertilization between different process domains, there seem to have been independent inventions of the idea in aeolian geomorphology by Bagnold in the 1930s and in hillslope studies by Ellison in the 1940s. Here we review the invention and development of the idea of transport capacity in the fluvial, aeolian, coastal, hillslope, dÃ©bris flow, and glacial process domains. As these various developments have occurred, different definitions have been used, which makes it both a difficult concept to test, and one that may lead to poor communications between those working in different domains of geomorphology. We argue that the original relation between the power of a flow and its ability to transport sediment can be challenged for three reasons. First, as sediment becomes entrained in a flow, the nature of the flow changes and so it is unreasonable to link the capacity of the water or wind only to the ability of the fluid to move sediment. Secondly, environmental sediment transport is complicated, and the range of processes involved in most movements means that simple relationships are unlikely to hold, not least because the movement of sediment often changes the substrate, which in turn affects the flow conditions. Thirdly, the inherently stochastic nature of sediment transport means that any capacity relationships do not scale either in time or in space. Consequently, new theories of sediment transport are needed to improve understanding and prediction and to guide measurement and management of all geomorphic systems.},

  abstract = {Bank erosion frequently occurs in the Lower Yellow River (LYR), playing an important role in the evolution of this braided river. A two-dimensional (2D) composite model is developed herein that consists of a depth-averaged 2D flow and sediment transport submodel and a bank-erosion submodel. The model incorporates a new technique for updating bank geometry during either degradational or aggradational bed evolution, allowing the two submodels to be closely combined. Using the model, the fluvial processes in the braided reach of the LYR between Huayuankou and Laitongzhai are simulated, and the calculated results generally agree with the field measurements, including the water-surface elevation, variation of water-surface width, and variations of cross-sectional profiles. The calculated average water-surface elevation in the study reach was  0.09 m  greater than the observed initial value, and the calculated mean bed elevation for six cross sections was  0.11 m  lower than the observed value after 24 days. These errors are attributed to the large variability of flow and sediment transport processes. Sensitivity tests of three groups of parameters are conducted, and these groups of parameters are related to flow and sediment transport, bank erosion, and model application, respectively. Analysis results of parameter sensitivity tests indicate that bank erodibility coefficient and critical shear stress for bank material are sensitive to the simulated bank erosion process. The lateral erosion distance at Huayuankou will increase by 19\% as the value of bank erodibility coefficient changes from 0.1 to 0.3, and it will decrease by 57\% as the value of critical shear stress for bank increases from 0.6 to  1.2 Nâˆ• m2   . Limited changes of other parameters have relatively small effects on the simulated results for this reach, and the maximum change extent of calculated results is less than 5\%. Because the process of sediment transport and bank erosion in the braided reach of the LYR is very complicated, further study is needed to verify the model.},

  abstract = {Abstract Channel bars are a major depositional feature in alluvial rivers and their morphodynamics has been investigated intensively in the past several decades. However, relatively less is known about how channel bars in alluvial rivers respond to river engineering and regulations. In this study, we assessed 30-yr morphologic changes of 30 large emerged bars located in a 223km reach of the highly regulated Lower Mississippi River from Vicksburg, Mississippi, to the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River diversion. Landsat imagery and river stage data between 1985 and 2015 were utilized to characterize bar morphologic features and quantify decadal changes. Based on bar surface areas estimated with the satellite images at different river stages, a rating curve was developed for each of the 30bars to determine their volumes. Results from this study show that the highly regulated river reach favored the growth of mid-channel and attached bars, while more than half of the point bars showed degradation. Currently, the mid-channel and attached bars accounted for 38\% and 34\% of the total volume of the 30bars. The average volume of a single mid-channel bar is over two times that of an attached bar and over four times that of a point bar. Overall, in the past three decades, the total volume of the studied 30bars increased by 110,118,000m3 (41\%). Total dike length in a dike field was found mostly contributing to the bar volume increase. Currently, the emerged volume of the 30bars was estimated approximately 378,183,000m3. The total bar volume is equivalent to 530millionmetrictons of coarse sand, based on an average measured bulk density of 1.4t/m3 for the bar sediment. The findings show that these bars are large sediment reservoirs.},

  abstract = {Abstract Alluvial rivers are shaped by interactions of flow and sediment transport. Their lower reaches to the world's oceans are highly dynamic, often presenting engineering and management challenges. Here we analyzed over 6,000 single-beam cross-sectional measurements surveyed in 1992, 2004, and 2013 in the last 500-km reach of the highly engineered Mississippi River, also known as the lowermost Mississippi River or LmMR, starting from the river's Gulf outlet to its avulsion into the Atchafalaya River. We applied inverse distance weighted interpolation to downscale the survey records into 10Â Ã—Â 10Â m digital elevation models. We assessed riverbed deformation from bank to bank and quantified changes in riverbed sediment volume. The goal of our study is to test the hypothesis that the lower reach of a large alluvial river can function as a conduit for sediment transport under the current engineering focus of navigation safety and flood control. Our analysis shows that in the past two decades, nearly 70\% of the riverine sand was trapped within the LmMR, and continuous riverbed aggradation occurred below the Mississippi-Atchafalaya diversion, presenting favorable backwater conditions for avulsion. Backwater effects have mainly controlled riverbed deformation in the LmMR, while flow reduction may have also contributed to the channel aggradation in the uppermost and lowermost reaches. The study reveals the considerable complexity of geomorphic responses of a large alluvial river to human interventions, strongly suggesting that future river engineering and management of the world's alluvial rivers should focus on strategies and solutions that will improve sediment transport.},

  abstract  = {Bed load was trapped during flood events over a 20-month period at the lower end of the Allt Dubhaig, a small river in Scotland with rapid downstream fining of gravel bed material on a slowly aggrading concave long profile. The channel bed near the trap is predominantly gravel with a secondary sand mode. Total transport in each event depended mainly on peak shear stress, rather than duration over a threshold. Bed load was mainly sand in smaller events, bimodal in intermediate events, and mainly gravel in the biggest floods. Mean and maximum grain diameter both increased with peak shear stress, but in different ways. Analysis of fractional transport rates and maximum grain size in relation to peak shear stress suggests that gravel transport is slightly size selective but sand transport is close to equal mobility. The slight selectivity in gravel transport is consistent with previous field studies of near-equilibrium unimodal beds and supports assumptions made in the numerical model of Hoey and Ferguson (1994), which successfully simulates the observed amount of downstream fining over the 2.5-km upstream of the bed load trap.},

Each mixture used the same gravel, and sand was added to produce mixtures containing 6, 15, 21, 27, and 34% sand. Control of other variables allows us to isolate the effect of bed sand content on transport. As sand content increases, gravel transport rates increase by orders of magnitude, even though the proportion of gravel in the bed decreases. The increase in gravel transport rate is most rapid over the range of bed sand content between 15 and 27%. The increase in transport rate is larger than predicted using standard scaling relations between transport rate and grain size, indicating that models of transport and sorting and predictions of stream channel response to sand inputs need to be revised to account for the influence of sand content. Bed surface grain size was measured at the end of each run. Surface grain size varied with sand content but showed little or no coarsening with flow strength and transport rate. This casts doubt on the idea that armor layers form at small flows and weaken or vanish with increasing flow and transport rate.},

Some flume experiments have been used to conclude that armor layers wash out during floods, although other experiments have produced a persistent armor layer. In the absence of clear field or flume evidence, we use a surface-based transport model in an inverse prediction of surface grain size as a function of transport rates observed in the field. The predicted surface grain size matches that observed at low flow and indicates that low-flow armor layers persist at large flows. In the field, transport grain size increases with transport rate, reducing or eliminating adjustments in bed surface grain size as flow and transport increase. A persistent armor layer considerably simplifies the prediction of sediment transport, hydraulic roughness, and habitat disturbance during floods.},

  abstract = {Abstract Numerical morphological modeling of braided rivers, using a physicsâ€�based approach, is increasingly used as a technique to explore controls on river pattern and, from an applied perspective, to simulate the impact of channel modifications. This paper assesses a depthâ€�averaged nonuniform sediment model (Delft3D) to predict the morphodynamics of a 2.5 km long reach of the braided Rees River, New Zealand, during a single highâ€�flow event. Evaluation of model performance primarily focused upon using highâ€�resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of Difference, derived from a fusion of terrestrial laser scanning and optical empirical bathymetric mapping, to compare observed and predicted patterns of erosion and deposition and reachâ€�scale sediment budgets. For the calibrated model, this was supplemented with planform metrics (e.g., braiding intensity). Extensive sensitivity analysis of model functions and parameters was executed, including consideration of numerical scheme for bed load component calculations, hydraulics, bed composition, bed load transport and bed slope effects, bank erosion, and frequency of calculations. Total predicted volumes of erosion and deposition corresponded well to those observed. The difference between predicted and observed volumes of erosion was less than the factor of two that characterizes the accuracy of the Gaeuman et al. bed load transport formula. Grain size distributions were best represented using two Ï† intervals. For unsteady flows, results were sensitive to the morphological time scale factor. The approach of comparing observed and predicted morphological sediment budgets shows the value of using natural experiment data sets for model testing. Sensitivity results are transferable to guide Delft3D applications to other rivers.},

  abstract  = {Eleven possible definitions of a bank-full have been used by various investigators. The active floodplain is the most meaningful bank-full level to the fluvial geomorphologist, whereas the banks of the valley flat are the most important to engineers. Comparison of 16 ways of determining bank-full discharge suggests that bank-full discharge at gaged sites should be obtained from the station's rating curve, where bank-full gage height is determined from a longitudinal profile of the floodplain along the entire reach. At ungaged sites, bank-full discharge can be estimated from the empirical equation of this study or from the Gauckler-Manning equation. In the latter case the resistance coefficient n should be estimated at the field site for bank-full flow; a measured low-flow n should not be used. Bank-full discharge does not have a common recurrence frequency among the rivers studied, and the discharge corresponding to the 1.5-year recurrence interval in most cases does not represent the bank-full discharge.},

  abstract = {This paper attempts to assess the accuracy of constant eddy viscosity, Elder and kâ€“Ïµ turbulence models in the numerical simulation of reach-scale compound channel flows using two-dimensional (2D) finite element methods. Assessment was conducted using benchmark stage-discharge data collected from straight and meandering compound channel configurations at the UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) Flood Channel Facility. For mesh resolutions and topologies used in reach-scale studies, all models were found to be adequate predictors (<5% error in predicted flow depth) of the stage-discharge relationship at moderate overbank flows (Figs. 1 and 2)Fig. 1Main channel cross-sectional details of the EPSRC FCF at a distorted scale (a) series A straight channel (b) series B meandering channel.Fig. 2Finite element meshes developed for the: (a) EPSRC FCF series A channel with trapezoidal cross-section; (b) EPSRC FCF series B channel with trapezoidal cross-section.. However, at inbank and low overbank flows the Elder and kâ€“Ïµ turbulence models can reproduce stage-discharge points with much greater accuracy than the constant eddy viscosity model. Hence, for an unsteady simulation where low flows are relevant a constant eddy viscosity turbulence closure may prove problematic. In terms of computed lateral distributions of depth-averaged velocity for both channel configurations, at higher depths (Relative depth=0.666) all turbulence models predict the velocity with greater accuracy than at a lower depth (Relative depth=0.333). At this latter depth, all turbulence models predict the depth-averaged longitudinal velocity distribution with poor accuracy (>20% error). Also, sensitivity of the turbulence parameter calibration with respect to the predicted flow depth showed that the constant eddy viscosity model's performance can be highly dependent on the choice of turbulence parameter value.},

The measurements are used to extract statistical distributions of sediment concentration and flux just above the bed. Observed mass fluxes (uc,wc) were well fit by quasi-exponential distributions, at all positions along the dune profile, similar to previous observations of single-particle momenta for bed loadÂ over flat beds. Observed concentrations of moving particles were well fit by negative-binomial distributions, also similar to previous observations over flat beds. These probability distributions relate to two recent stochastic theories, previously derived and verified for uniform flow over flat beds. It is hypothesized that these theories may also be used as a local approximation in natural-scale flows with bed forms.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Interactions between floodplains and wood date to the Carboniferous, when stable, multithread channel deposits appear with the evolution of tree-like plants. Foundational geologic texts, such as Lyell's, 1830 Principles of Geology, describe floodplain!!e!!wood interactions, yet modern technical literature describes floodplain!!e!!wood interactions in detail for only a very limited range of environments. This likely reflects more than a century of deforestation, flow regulation, and channel engineering, including instream wood removal, which has resulted in severe wood depletion in most of the world's river networks. Instream wood affects floodplain form and process by altering flow resistance, conveyance and channel!!e!!floodplain connectivity, and influencing lateral and vertical accretion of floodplains. Instream wood reflects floodplain form and process as the floodplain influences wood recruitment via bank erosion and overbank flow, and wood transport and storage via floodplain effects on stage-discharge relations and flow resistance. Examining turnover times for instream wood at the reach scale in the context of a wood budget, floodplain characteristics influence fluvial transport and dynamics (wood recruitment), valley geometry (wood transport and storage), and hydraulics and river biota (wood decay and breakage). Accumulations of wood that vary from in situ jams and beaver dams in small channels to transport jams and log rafts in very large rivers can create stable, multithread channels and floodplain wetlands. Floodplain!!e!!wood interactions are best understood for a subset of small to medium-sized rivers in the temperate zone. We know little about these interactions on very large rivers, or on rivers in the tropical or boreal regions. This review suggests that most, if not all, channels and floodplains within forested catchments in the temperate zone historically had much greater wood loads and consequently much more obvious and important influences from wood than do heavily modified contemporary catchments. For many rivers in the temperate zone, direct and indirect removal of instream wood very likely caused a fundamental shift in channel and floodplain process and form, as has been demonstrated in detail for specific rivers of diverse size in several regions. Failure to explicitly include floodplain!!e!!wood interactions creates a misleading conceptual model of floodplain dynamics in forested catchments.},

  abstract  = {The relative importance in geomorphic processes of extreme or catastrophic events and more frequent events of smaller magnitude can be measured in terms of (1) the relative amounts of "work" done on the landscape and (2) in terms of the formation of specific features of the landscape. For many processes, above the level of competence, the rate of movement of material can be expressed as a power function of some stress, as for example, shear stress. Because the frequency distributions of the magnitudes of many natural events, such as floods, rainfall, and wind speeds, approximate log-normal distributions, the product of frequency and rate, a measure of the work performed by events having different frequencies and magnitudes will attain a maximum. The frequency at which this maximum occurs provides a measure of the level at which the largest portion of the total work is accomplished. Analysis of records of sediment transported by rivers indicates that the largest portion of the total load is carried by flows which occur on the average once or twice each year. As the variability of the flow increases and hence as the size of the drainage basin decreases, a larger percentage of the total load is carried by less frequent flows. In many basins 90 per cent of the sediment is removed by storm discharges which recur at least once every five years. Transport of sand and dust by wind in general follows the same laws. The extreme velocities associated with infrequent events are compensated for by their rarity, and it is found that the greatest bulk of sediment is transported by more moderate events. Many rivers are competent to erode both bed and banks during moderate flows. Observations of natural channels suggest that the channel shape as well as the dimensions of meandering rivers appear to be associated with flows at or near the bankfull stage. The fact that the bankfull stage recurs on the average once every year or two years indicates that these features of many alluvial rivers are controlled by these more frequent flows rather than by the rarer events of catastrophic magnitude. Because the equilibrium form of wind-blown dunes and of wave-formed beaches is quite unstable, the frequency of the events responsible for their form is less clearly definable. However, dune form and orientation are determined by both wind velocity and frequency. Similarly, a hypothetical example suggests that beach slope oscillates about a mean value related in part to wave characteristics generated by winds of moderate speed. Where stresses generated by frequent events are incompetent to transport available materials, less frequent ones of greater magnitude are obviously required. Closer observation of many geomorphic processes is required before the relative importance of different processes and of events of differing magnitude and frequency in the formation of given features of the landscape can be adequately evaluated.},

  abstract = {A depth-averaged two-dimensional (2D) numerical model for unsteady flow and nonuniform sediment transport in open channels is established using the finite volume method on a nonstaggered, curvilinear grid. The 2D shallow water equations are solved by the SIMPLE(C) algorithms with the Rhie and Chowâ€™s momentum interpolation technique. The proposed sediment transport model adopts a nonequilibrium approach for nonuniform total-load sediment transport. The bed load and suspended load are calculated separately or jointly according to sediment transport mode. The sediment transport capacity is determined by four formulas which are capable of accounting for the hiding and exposure effects among different size classes. An empirical formula is proposed to consider the effects of the gravity on the sediment transport capacity and the bed-load movement direction in channels with steep slopes. Flow and sediment transport are simulated in a decoupled manner, but the sediment module adopts a coupling procedure for the computations of sediment transport, bed change, and bed material sorting. The model has been tested against several experimental and field cases, showing good agreement between the simulated results and measured data.},

The state-of-the-art in sediment transport modeling approaches is described, such as non-equilibrium transport models, non-uniform total-load transport models, and semi-coupled and coupled procedures for flow and sediment calculations. Sediment transport theory is discussed and many newly-developed, non-uniform sediment transport formulae are presented. The many worked examples illustrate various conditions, such as reservoir sedimentation; channel erosion due to dam construction; channel widening and meandering; local scour around in-stream hydraulic structures; vegetation effects on channel morphodynamic processes; cohesive sediment transport; dam-break fluvial processes and contaminant transport.

  abstract =  {The forcing effect of channel width variations on free bars is investigated in this study using a two-dimensional depth-averaged morphodynamic model. The novel feature of the model is the incorporation of a characteristic dissipative Galerkin (CDG) upwinding scheme in the bed evolution module. A correction for the secondary flows induced by streamline curvature is also included, allowing for simulations of bar growth and migration in channels with width variations beyond the small-amplitude regimes. The model is tested against a variety of experimental data ranging from purely forced and free bars to coexisting bed forms in the variable-width channel. The CDG scheme effectively dissipates local bed oscillations, thus sustains numerical stabilities. The results show that the global effect of width variations on bar height is invariably suppressive. Such effect increases with the dimensionless amplitude AC and wave number Î»C of width variations. For small AC, Î»C has little effects on bar height; for AC beyond small amplitudes, however, the suppressing effect depends on both AC and Î»C. The suppressing effect on bar length increases also with both AC and Î»C, but is much weaker than that on bar height. The global effect of width variations on bar celerity can be suppressive or enhancive, depending on the combination of AC and Î»C. For smaller Î»C, the effect on bar celerity is enhancive; for larger Î»C, bar celerity tends to increase at small AC but decreases for AC beyond small amplitudes. We present herein an unprecedented data set verifying the theoretical prediction on celerity enhancement. Full suppression of bar growth above the theoretically predicted threshold AC was not observed, regardless of the adopted amplitude of initial bed perturbation A. The global effects of width variations on free bars can be quantified using a forcing factor FC that integrates the effects of AC and Î»C. The suppressing effects on bar height and length are both proportional to FC2.16; the global effect on bar celerity is, however, a parabolic function of FC.},

  abstract = {Abstract Accounting for the burial of tracer particles during bedload transport is an important component in the formulation of tracer dispersal in rivers. Herein we propose a modified active layer formulation, which accounts for the effect of burial and admits analytical solutions, enabling insightful exploration of the phenomenon of superdiffusion of bedload tracers at the intermediate timescale. This phenomenon has been observed in recent numerical results using the 2-D Exner-Based Master Equation. By assuming that tracers in the active layer can exchange with nontracer particles in the substrate layer to preserve mass, and that tracers entering the substrate layer get permanently trapped during the timescale of analysis, we are able to deduce governing equations for the tracer concentration in both layers. The active layer tracer concentration is shown to be governed by an advection-diffusion equation with a sink term, and the increase of tracers in the substrate layer is driven by a corresponding source term. The solution for the variance of tracer population is analytically determined and can be approximated by the sum of a diffusion-induced scaling (âˆ�t1) and an advection-induced scaling (âˆ�t3) terms at the intermediate timescale, which explains the phenomenon of superdiffusion. The proposed formulation is shown to be able to capture the key characteristics of tracer transport as inferred by comparison with available results of numerical simulations.},

Field measurements of bedload transport are notoriously difficult, which precludes understanding many of the processes and mechanics associated with grain motion. Such uncertainties are exacerbated when using bedload transport equations, most of which were derived using data from a single river or set of laboratory flume experiments. Recently, laboratory experiments have focused on better quantifying the processes that impact bedload fluxes, which can then be used to improve sediment transport predictions. We highlight recent advances in laboratory instrumentation that can be used in bedload transport studies. In particular, more accurate ways to measure bedload fluxes, near-bed turbulence, bed grain sizes, and topography hold great promise. Laboratory experiments have also fundamentally improved our understanding of the influence of sediment supply and armoring processes on bedload fluxes and channel conditions. The importance of flow hydrographs in controlling total bedload transport rates and bedload hysteresis has also been demonstrated using flume experiments. Finally, many details about the mechanics of grain motion including flow turbulence, bed arrangement, and particle transport statistics are only possible through laboratory investigations, and we feature key knowledge gaps that can be improved with further study.},

Results are summarized as follows: (a) Under normal conditions, the range of change in bed level was on the order of a few centimeters during a period of half a month, 10 to 50 centimeters in the different seasons and 40 to 60 centimeters in the comparison between flood season and dry season, on average of the along-channel survey sites. A maximum change could be several times the average change, (b) The average along-channel depth was negatively correlated with the river water discharge, (c) The response of bed-level of the South Passage lagged changes in river discharge at the Datong Station by 1 to 2 months, which reflects the influence of the 600 km distance between the hydrological station and the river mouth, (d) In taking into account this lag effect, a correlative coefficient of 0.90 was found. Based on these data, the range of annual change in the channel bed level was forecasted to be the order of 50 cm for normal discharges, 20 cm for minimal difference in seasonal discharge and 100 cm for maximum difference in seasonal discharge, (e) A ten year storm event was found to result in an average accretion of 60 cm, which superimposed upon the river-induced seasonal change, (f) A good spatial unanimity of erosion and accretion events was found for the main part of the channel. Conclusions include the following: (a) The channel bed-level of the Yangtze River mouth is sensitive to both seasonal changes in river discharge and to storm events. Under conditions of normal river water discharge and severe storms, the combined annual difference in average bed level can reach the order of 1.0 m. It is probable that accretion in flood season could exceed 1.5 m in the case of co-occurrence of extreme high water discharge and extreme severe storms, (b) In view of a good positive correlation between river water discharge and riverine sediment discharge, the response to water discharge suggests a response of bed-level to the sediment discharge, (c) Due to its regulative function in annual distribution of the river discharge and its role in reducing sediment supply, the Three Gorge Dam will perhaps reduce the range of annual change in the bed level of the river mouth channels and increase the depth of the navigational channels.},

Due to the morphological behaviour of the river, navigation is subject to hindrance in some locations and frequent maintenance is being carried out. It is of a primary interest for the river manager to be able to evaluate different maintenance strategies to ensure a sustainable navigation channel. Accordingly, a detailed quasi 3-dimensional morphological model that covers the Rhine branches in the Netherlands was created. In this paper we present some innovative techniques which have been recently developed to undertake this task, e.g. domain decomposition, simulation management tool, and a novel dredging and dumping functionality. Domain decomposition is a technique in which a model domain is subdivided into several smaller model domains. Computations can be carried out separately on these domains. The simulation management tool allows for efficiently carrying out long-term computation with variable discharge; it helps reduce the computational time significantly. Dredging and dumping operations that allow carrying out actual river maintenance strategy. We briefly presents a case study that evaluates the effect of enlarging the navigation channel on the yearly dredging volume by applying a simple dredging scenario in the Waal River.},

  abstract  = {Two-fluid models are central to the simulation of transport processes in two-phase homogenized systems. Even though this physical model has been widely accepted, an inherently nonhyperbolic and nonconservative ill-posed problem arises from the mathematical point of view. It has been demonstrated that this drawback occurs even for a very simplified model, i.e., an inviscid model with no interfacial terms. Much effort has been made to remedy this anomaly and in the literature two different types of approaches can be found. On one hand, extra terms with physical origin are added to model the interphase interaction, but even though this methodology seems to be realistic, several extra parameters arise from each added term with the associated difficulty in their estimation. On the other hand, mathematical based-work has been done to find a way to remove the complex eigenvalues obtained with two-fluid model equations. Preconditioned systems, characterized as a projection of the complex eigenvalues over the real axis, may be one of the choices. The aim of this paper is to introduce a simple and novel mathematical strategy based on the application of a preconditioning mass matrix that circumvents the drawback caused by the nonhyperbolic behavior of the original model. Although the mass and momentum conservation equations are modified, the target of this methodology is to present another way to reach a steady-state solution (using a time marching scheme), greatly valued by researchers in industrial process design. Attaining this goal is possible because only the temporal term is affected by the preconditioner. The obtained matrix has two parameters that correct the nonhyperbolic behavior of the model: the first one modifies the eigenvalues removing their imaginary part and the second one recovers the real part of the original eigenvalues. Besides the theoretical development of the preconditioning matrix, several numerical results are presented to show the validity of the method.},

The Rouse profile is modified to consider the nonequilibrium transport of suspended sediment. The spatial lag between the instantaneous flow properties (e.g.,\&nbsp;velocity, bed shear stress) and the rate of bed load transport in unsteady flow is quantified by using an adaptation length, which is derived theoretically by applying the momentum principle in the bed load layer. This new method for calculating the adaptation length is verified using data from several experiments and yields better results than other empirical formulas for a wide range of shear stress. The nonequilibrium model is applied to simulate a series of laboratory dam-break flows over erodible beds, and the simulated results agree well with the experimental measurements.},

It also can reflect the dependency relation between river bed sediment and flow intensity. In this paper, the critical pattern of sediment movement in the near-wall region of a sandy river bed was analyzed. According to the principle of momentum balance, the critical settling-rising condition of bed material in a sandy river bed was found to be instantaneous turbulent velocity equal to 2.7 times the sediment settling velocity in quiescent water. Based on a vertical instantaneous turbulent velocity with a Gaussian distribution, a theoretical relation for calculating the particle size distribution of bed materials in a sandy river bed without pre-known characteristic grain sizes was developed by solving a stochastic equation. The formula is verified using measured data, and the results show that the proposed formula was in accordance with the measured data. This study has theoretical significance and practical value for determining the bed material particle size distribution of the sandy bed of alluvial rivers.},

Based on the Exner equation, an expression of mass conservation of sediment, we distinguish three types of equilibrium defined as static and dynamic, of which two different types exist. Other expressions such as statistical and quasi-equilibrium which do not strictly satisfy the Exner conditions are also acknowledged for their practical use. The choice of a temporal scale is imperative to analyse the type of equilibrium. We discuss the difference between morphodynamic equilibrium in the �real world� (nature) and the �virtual world� (model). Modelling studies rely on simplifications of the real world and lead to understanding of process interactions. A variety of factors affect the use of virtual-world predictions in the real world (e.g., variability in environmental drivers and variability in the setting) so that the concept of morphodynamic equilibrium should be mathematically unequivocal in the virtual world and interpreted over the appropriate spatial and temporal scale in the real world. We draw examples from estuarine settings which are subject to various governing factors which broadly include hydrodynamics, sedimentology and landscape setting. Following the traditional �tide-wave-river� ternary diagram, we summarize studies to date that explore the �virtual world�, discuss the type of equilibrium reached and how it relates to the real world.},

Two types of computational verification are performed for the proposed model. At first the model is validated with the analytical solution. The computational accuracy of the proposed model was tested for different time steps and grid size. At second, the results produced by the model were compared with those obtained when the Crank-Nicolson scheme is used to discretize the energy equation. In this case of results comparison the fluid flow and heat transfer phenomena were modeled for spirally wounded waterwall tubes of the combustion chamber in a supercritical boiler. A good agreement was found between the results produced by the proposed model and those obtained by using the analytical and Crank-Nicolson approaches. Therefore, the proposed model can be regarded as a useful tool for the design and monitoring of this type of heated surfaces. Moreover, the model can be applied in power units simulators.},

  abstract  = {Today, vast areas of drylands in semiarid climates face the dangers of desertification. To understand the driving mechanisms behind this effect, many theoretical models have been created. These models provide insight into the resilience of dryland ecosystems. However, until now, comparisons with reality were merely visual. In this article, a systematic comparison is performed using data on wavenumber, biomass, and migration speed of vegetation patterns in Somalia. In agreement with reaction{\textendash}diffusion models, a wide distribution of regular pattern wavenumbers was found in the data. This highlights the potential for extrapolating predictions of those models to real ecosystems, including those that elucidate how spatial self-organization of vegetation enhances ecosystem resilience.Spatial self-organization of dryland vegetation constitutes one of the most promising indicators for an ecosystem{\textquoteright}s proximity to desertification. This insight is based on studies of reaction{\textendash}diffusion models that reproduce visual characteristics of vegetation patterns observed on aerial photographs. However, until now, the development of reliable early warning systems has been hampered by the lack of more in-depth comparisons between model predictions and real ecosystem patterns. In this paper, we combined topographical data, (remotely sensed) optical data, and in situ biomass measurements from two sites in Somalia to generate a multilevel description of dryland vegetation patterns. We performed an in-depth comparison between these observed vegetation pattern characteristics and predictions made by the extended-Klausmeier model for dryland vegetation patterning. Consistent with model predictions, we found that for a given topography, there is multistability of ecosystem states with different pattern wavenumbers. Furthermore, observations corroborated model predictions regarding the relationships between pattern wavenumber, total biomass, and maximum biomass. In contrast, model predictions regarding the role of slope angles were not corroborated by the empirical data, suggesting that inclusion of small-scale topographical heterogeneity is a promising avenue for future model development. Our findings suggest that patterned dryland ecosystems may be more resilient to environmental change than previously anticipated, but this enhanced resilience crucially depends on the adaptive capacity of vegetation patterns.},

  abstract = {Abstract This Report examines two key issues emerging when one deals with high-resolution data for particle tracks in bed-load transport. The first relates to how a particle motion/rest state is defined; using different definitions of motion changes the mean values computed for particle hop length and duration, that are key properties for phenomenological analysis of bed-load transport and quantitative estimation of the associated rates. The second issue refers to the experimental bias due to considering a finite observation area within the channel bed. A conceptual presentation of the problem is here complemented by an analysis of experimental data, from both the literature and new experiments with weak bed-load transport. Four definitions of motion were employed, together with two different ways (correcting or not the bias due to the observation area) of computing mean values from measured hop data. The results demonstrate that using different definitions and operational methods highly changes the mean values of hop-related quantities. This may explain the scatter among literature data and challenges future Lagrangian investigation of bed-load transport.},

  abstract = {Abstract Rivers typically present heterogeneous bed material, but the effects of seiment nonuniformity on river bar characteristics are still unclear. This work investigates the impact of sediment size heterogeneity on alternate bars with a morphodynamic numerical model. The model is first used to reproduce a laboratory experiment showing alternate bar formation with nonuniform bed material. Subsequently, the influence of sediment size heterogeneity on alternate bars is investigated distinguishing hybrid from free bars, definition based on the presence/absence of morphodynamic forcing, considering the results of nine scenarios. In four of them, a transverse obstacle is used to generate forcing. The computations are carried out with the Telemac-Mascaret system solving the two-dimensional shallow-water equations with a finite element approach, accounting for horizontal and vertical sediment sorting processes. The results show that sediment heterogeneity affects free migrating and hybrid bars in a different way. The difference lies in the presence/absence of a migration front, so that distinct relations between bed topography, bed shear stress, and sediment sorting are obtained. Sediment sorting and associated planform redistribution of bed roughness only slightly modify free migrating bar morphodynamics, whereas hybrid bars are greatly impacted, with decreased amplitude and increased wavelength. Increased sediment size heterogeneity increases the degree of sediment sorting, while the sorting pattern remains the same for both free and hybrid bars. Moreover, it produces averagely higher, longer, and faster free bars, while in the case of hybrid bars their wavelength is increased but no general trend can be determined for their amplitude.},

The currently accepted view is that they are steady only if the width-to-depth ratio is at the value of resonance or if the bars are forced by a steady local perturbation. Experimental observations, however, show that steady bars are also present in cases of migrating bars without permanent forcings. The companion paper by Crosato  \&  Desta (2009) reviews these experimental observations and presents a numerical analysis using a 2D depth-averaged morphological model. Here we explain the occurrence of steady bars using a 2D linear stability analysis. The temporal growth rate of steady bars is zero under constant conditions, but is found to become positive if the conditions exhibit small temporal fluctuations. These fluctuations could result from discharge variations or the mere presence of migrating alternate bars. Since steady bars are seen as a prerequisite to explain meandering of alluvial rivers, these findings imply that neither resonant width-to-depth ratios nor steady local perturbations are necessary conditions for the onset of river meandering.},

It was given much attention in times of Leopold and Maddock (1953) and Colby (1964) from records of outstanding case studies. Field data from a station in a contracted, long reach of the large sand-bed Pilcomayo River –1192 newly typed in forms– are presented, with sediment concentration in the database up to 60 kg/m3, mostly wash load. Water surface rises and falls during a flood event, whereas streambed evolves in reverse (it renders the analogy to an accordion). Streambed scouring accounts for 36% of the change in flow area during floods and data reveal scouring up to 4 m from the streambed elevation when flood starts. Velocity data display large hysteresis loops inexplicable by unsteady flow only. Once streambed starts to fall, river bed scour is self-sustaining. Water depth gradient appears to be a crucial variable in a novel equation for transient scour and fill derived from Exner equation. It turns out that flow non-uniformity is relevant to explain transient scour and fill in contrast to flow unsteadiness, which is not. Quasi-steady gradually varied flow equation solved along the contracted reach is the base for a model that captures well the recorded bed evolution. The model explains most of the transient scour and fill by the downstream expansion, but the non-uniform flow and the bed material suspended load also play a role. The model fails on the days of highest sediment concentrations.},

A relation for the areal coverage factor for armoring on a plane bed is first formulated as a function of degradation depth and bedmaterial characteristics, and is then modified by introducing correction factors for the effect of bed forms and the stochastic nature of sediment motion. For the simulation of hydraulic sorting, bed sediments are assumed to be mixed homogeneously in a mixed‐layer depth approximately equal to average bedform height, and the composition of mixed‐layer materials is adjusted to satisfy the continuity equation for each sediment size fraction. These formulations are applied in a 20‐year simulation of bed degradation in the middle Missouri River reach downstream of Gavins Point Dam. It is found that the simulated bedsediment composition, including the two‐layer structure comprising the top armor coat and the underlying finer sediments, is in good agreement with the observed Missouri River bed characteristics.},

  abstract = {Flow over a developed bottom topography in a bend has been investigated experimentally. The measuring section is in the outer-bank half of the cross section at 60° into the bend. Spatial distributions of the mean velocities, turbulent stresses, and mean-flow and turbulent kinetic energy are presented. The cross-sectional motion contains two cells of circulation: besides the classical helical motion (center-region cell), a weaker counterrotating cell (outer-bank cell) is observed in the corner formed by the outer bank and the water surface. The downstream velocity in the outer half-section is higher than the one in straight uniform flow; the core of maximum velocities is found close to the separation between both circulation cells, well below the water surface. The turbulence structure in a bend is different from that in a straight flow, most notably in a reduction of the turbulent activity toward the outer bank. Both the outer-bank cell and reduced turbulent activity have a protective effect on the outer bank and the adjacent bottom and thus influence the stability of the flow perimeter and the bend morphology.},

  abstract = {The transported load in most fluvial systems, including gravel-bedded rivers, includes fine-grained sediment. Models for suspended sediment transport have focused on sand-covered beds, rendering incomplete the theoretical and empirical framework for predicting fine sediment transport and routing. We conducted laboratory experiments involving sand transport over large immobile grains. The experiments were scaled such that immobile particles were much larger than the mobile sediment, but less than 10\% of flow depth, and that bed shear stresses, scaled by the size of the mobile sediment, were indicative of transport in suspension. The experiments were conducted in equilibrium transport and included measurements of near-bed sediment concentration and interstitial sand storage for a range of flow and transport rates. Partial filling of grain interstices occurred over a narrow range of flow and transport rates, indicating a sharp threshold between no interstitial sand storage and a sand-covered bed. Less sand coverage on the bed resulted in higher near-bed sand concentrations per unit area of sand than runs with greater sand coverage. As sand bed elevation decreased relative to the coarse grains, turbulent wakes shed by the large grains appeared to enhance grain entrainment more than the corresponding decrease in bed area covered by sand resulted in decreased entrainment. Elevated concentrations were maintained until the bed was depleted of fine sediment. These results are formalized in a proposed sand elevation correction function that scales the entrainment rate for a bed partially covered by sand to the entrainment rate that would be predicted for a sand-covered bed.},

  abstract = {Abstract Data from tracer experiments were compiled and analysed in order to explore the role of geomorphological, hydrological and sedimentological constraints on fluvial gravel transport in gravel-bed rivers. A large data set from 217 transport episodes of tagged stones were compiled from 33 scientific papers. Our analyses showed that while magnitude of peak discharge is a major control on gravel transport and mobility, tracer travel distances show some scale dependence on the morphological configuration of the channel. Our results also highlight differences in the way tracers are displaced between step–pool and riffle and pool channels. The riffle–pool sequence seems to be a more efficient trap for travelling gravels than the step–pool pair. In addition, in step–pool channels there are clear differences in tracer transport between observations of first displacements after tracer seeding (unconstrained-stone conditions), and second and subsequent observations of tracer displacements (constrained-stone conditions). The comparison between tracer experiments under constrained conditions and those under unconstrained conditions also highlights the importance of bed state and structures in gravel mobility. The results of this study confirm that sediment transport in gravel-bed rivers is a complex process, whereby sedimentological and geomorphological controls are superimposed on the hydraulic forcing. © 2018 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract       = {This paper presents a hydraulic and morphological analysis of the Lower Jamuna in Bangladesh with a focus on two key bifurcations that are important for stabilization of the Lower Jamuna reach. We used ground measurements, historical data, multispectral satellite images from various sources as well as numerical models. We carried out hydraulic analyses of the changes and their peculiarities, such as flow distributions at the bifurcation and hysteresis of the stage–discharge relationships. We supplemented our analysis by using numerical models to simulate discharge distribution at the bifurcations under various flow and riverbed conditions. We developed an advanced and automated satellite image processing application for the Lower Jamuna, referred to as Morphology Monitor (MoMo), using the Google Earth Engine. MoMo was found to be an effective tool for a rapid assessment and analysis of the changes in deep-channel and sandbar areas. It is also useful for monitoring and assessing riverbank and char erosion and accretion, which is important not only for morphological but also ecological impact assessment. The application can be adapted as an operational tool as well. Furthermore, we assessed the evolution of deep channels at the bifurcations based on regularly and extensively measured bathymetry data. The analysis was carried out in complement with morphological modeling, particularly for short-term prediction. In this paper we present the major findings of the analysis and discuss their implications for adaptive river management.},

  abstract    = {The purpose of this investigation is to get more insight in the turbulence structure of water-flow in a curved channel. Therefor laser doppler measurements are performed in a rectangular laboratory flume with one cicular 180°-bend, with a radius of 4.1 m; the width of the flume is 0.5 m , the depth is 5 to 5½ cm, the mean velocity is 0.25 m/s. Besides the three time-averaged velocity components, the following turbulence quantities are measured: the three turbulence intensities, the vertical and the lateral turbulent shear stress, and the turbulence viscosity that is connected with the vertical strain rate of the longitudinal velocity. The measuring-results are discussed in a descriptive way; hereby comparison is made with standard-distributions from literature, while changes in the bend are explained as much as possible; no comparison is made with results of a mathematical computation. The principal results can be summarized as follows: The secondary flow velocities are 20 to 30% underestimated by the distribution of Kalkwijk and De Vriend (1980), which is based on the assumption of a logarithmic velocity distribution and a parabolic viscosity distribution. The turbulence quantities change considerably in the bend. These changes can for the greater part be explained from changes of the production terms in the transport-equations, as a result af changes'in strain rates of the time-averaged velocities. The principal changes of strain rates are: a) an extra vertical strain rate (av/az) of the radial velocity, as a result of the secundary currents; b) a reduction (mainly after the 29°-measuring-section) of the vertical strain rate (au/az) of the longitudinale velocity, as a result of the secondary flow convection, bijwhich the longitudinal velocity is considerably (up to 14%) reduced in the upper half of the depth; c) local extra longitudinal strain rates (au/ax) as a result of secondary flow convection; d) local extra longitudinal strain rates (au/ax) at the beginning of the bend, as a result of the developing radial slope of the waterlevel.},

  abstract = {A new empirical equation for alternate bar height is introduced. It is assumed that the bars are formed under a steady and uniform flow; the stage of interest is that where bars have grown to their fully developed state. The equation is developed on the basis of dimensional considerations and all data available to the authors; the formulation also incorporates findings by stability analysis. The data result from a total of 191 flume experiments reported in 16 different works carried out from 1961 to 2014 using either sand or gravel as bed material. Both fully rough and transitionally rough flows were used in the experiments. Overall, width-to-depth ratios and relative depths varied from 3.5 to 54.4 and 3.8 to 191, respectively; the ratios of bed shear stress to critical bed shear stress ranged from 1.1 to 14.7. Data from the Naka River, Japan, are also used. The equation correlates bar height, normalized by flow depth, with the excess width-to-depth ratio (B/h) with regard to the smallest, or critical, value of B/h at which alternate bars occur as well as with the relative depth and, in the case of transitionally rough flows, also the grain-size Reynolds number. It is shown that when compared with previous empirical equations, the present equation produces a considerably improved overall alignment of the data with the perfect agreement line and a significant larger (nearly double) percentage of data falling within the 20\% error range. The results by the present equation are also substantially more congruent with those derived from existing theoretical and numerical analyses of the development of alternate bars, and more specifically, those resulting from a stability analysis of the phenomenon. As a by-product of this work, a first comparative evaluation of existing equations for alternate bar height is also presented.},

  abstract = {Free-flowing rivers (FFRs) support diverse, complex and dynamic ecosystems globally, providing important societal and economic services. Infrastructure development threatens the ecosystem processes, biodiversity and services that these rivers support. Here we assess the connectivity status of 12 million kilometres of rivers globally and identify those that remain free-flowing in their entire length. Only 37 per cent of rivers longer than 1,000 kilometres remain free-flowing over their entire length and 23 per cent flow uninterrupted to the ocean. Very long FFRs are largely restricted to remote regions of the Arctic and of the Amazon and Congo basins. In densely populated areas only few very long rivers remain free-flowing, such as the Irrawaddy and Salween. Dams and reservoirs and their up- and downstream propagation of fragmentation and flow regulation are the leading contributors to the loss of river connectivity. By applying a new method to quantify riverine connectivity and map FFRs, we provide a foundation for concerted global and national strategies to maintain or restore them.},

  abstract = {Climate change has led to concerns about increasing river floods resulting from the greater water-holding capacity of a warmer atmosphere1. These concerns are reinforced by evidence of increasing economic losses associated with flooding in many parts of the world, including Europe2. Any changes in river floods would have lasting implications for the design of flood protection measures and flood risk zoning. However, existing studies have been unable to identify a consistent continental-scale climatic-change signal in flood discharge observations in Europe3, because of the limited spatial coverage and number of hydrometric stations. Here we demonstrate clear regional patterns of both increases and decreases in observed river flood discharges in the past five decades in Europe, which are manifestations of a changing climate. Our results--arising from the most complete database of European flooding so far--suggest that: increasing autumn and winter rainfall has resulted in increasing floods in northwestern Europe; decreasing precipitation and increasing evaporation have led to decreasing floods in medium and large catchments in southern Europe; and decreasing snow cover and snowmelt, resulting from warmer temperatures, have led to decreasing floods in eastern Europe. Regional flood discharge trends in Europe range from an increase of about 11 per cent per decade to a decrease of 23 per cent. Notwithstanding the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the observational record, the flood changes identified here are broadly consistent with climate model projections for the next century4,5, suggesting that climate-driven changes are already happening and supporting calls for the consideration of climate change in flood risk management.},

  abstract = {We derive an idealized model of a gravel-sand river bifurcation and analyze its stability properties. The model requires nodal point relations that describe the ratio of the supply of gravel and sand to the two downstream branches. The model predicts changes in bed elevation and bed surface gravel content in the two bifurcates under conditions of a constant water discharge, sediment supply, base level, and channel width and under the assumption of a branch-averaged approach of the bifurcates. The stability analysis reveals more complex behavior than for unisize sediment: three to five equilibrium solutions exist rather than three. In addition, we find that under specific parameter settings the initial conditions in the bifurcates determine to which of the equilibrium states the system evolves. Our approach has limited predictive value for real bifurcations due to neglecting several effects (e.g., transverse bed slope, alternate bars, upstream flow asymmetry, and bend sorting), yet it provides a first step in addressing mixed-size sediment mechanisms in modeling the dynamics of river bifurcations.},

However, many existing morphodynamic models predict unrealistically high channel incision, which is often dampened by increased gravity-driven sediment transport on side-slopes by up to two orders of magnitude too high. Here we show that such arbitrary calibrations dramatically bias sediment dynamics, channel patterns, and rate of morphological change. For five different models bracketing a range of scales and environments, we found that it is impossible to calibrate a model on both sediment transport magnitude and morphology. Consequently, present calibration practice may cause an order magnitude error in either morphology or morphological change. We show how model design can be optimized for different applications. We discuss the major implications for model interpretation and a critical knowledge gap.},

  abstract = {The active layer model (Hirano, 1971) is frequently used for modeling mixed-size sediment river morphodynamic processes. It assumes that all the dynamics of the bed surface are captured by a homogeneous top layer that interacts with the flow. Although successful in reproducing a wide range of phenomena, it has two problems: (1) It may become mathematically ill-posed, which causes the model to lose its predictive capabilities, and (2) it does not capture dispersion of tracer sediment. We extend the active layer model by accounting for conservation of the sediment in transport and obtain a new model that overcomes the two problems. We analytically assess the model properties and discover an instability mechanism associated with the formation of waves under conditions in which the active layer model is ill-posed. Numerical simulations using the new model show that it is capable of reproducing two laboratory experiments conducted under conditions in which the active layer model is ill-posed. The new model captures the formation of waves and mixing due to an increase in active layer thickness. Simulations of tracer dispersion show that the model reproduces reasonably well a laboratory experiment under conditions in which the effect of temporary burial of sediment due to bedforms is negligible. Simulations of a field experiment illustrate that the model does not capture the effect of temporary burial of sediment by bedforms.},

Model studies revealed that patterned ecosystems may respond in a nonlinear way to environmental change, meaning that gradual changes result in rapid degradation. We analyze this response through stability analysis of patterned states of an arid ecosystem model. This analysis goes one step further than the frequently applied Turing analysis, which only considers stability of uniform states. We found that patterned arid ecosystems systematically respond in two ways to changes in rainfall: (1) by changing vegetation patch biomass or (2) by adapting pattern wavelength. Minor adaptations of pattern wavelength are constrained to conditions of slow change within a high rainfall regime, and high levels of stochastic variation in biomass (noise). Major changes in pattern wavelength occur under conditions of either low rainfall, rapid change or low levels of noise. Such conditions facilitate strong interactions between vegetation patches, which can trigger a sudden loss of half the patches or a transition to a degraded bare state. These results highlight that ecosystem responses may critically depend on rates, rather than magnitudes, of environmental change. Our study shows how models can increase our understanding of these dynamics, provided that analyses go beyond the conventional Turing analysis.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper presents an exploratory study that comprises the implementation and comparison of different approaches and parameterization of sediment transport mechanisms in a process-based morphological model for simulating river dunes. The purpose of this study was to assess the underlying physical processes associated with sediment transport and dune evolution simulated by the model using two different bedload transport models: a non-equilibrium approach considering saltation distance and an equilibrium approach with the incorporation of the effect of the local bed slope. The study comprised detailed analysis of the bed shear stress and sediment transport over a dune during time varying flows, comparing both transport models and revealing distinctive transient features of bedload transport and dune evolution. We also improved a non-equilibrium transport model by incorporating a formulation for sediment saltation distance as a length-scale. Using both sediment transport approaches, the morphological model was applied to replicate a large-scale field experiment. Notably, the model yielded the quasi-equilibrium dune feature reasonably well using either sediment-transport formulation. However, detailed analysis of simulated spatial and temporal features of sediment transport and the dune evolution process were found to be noticeably different. Even though both sediment transport mechanisms appear to work adequately at a basic level, the major difference between the two approaches is the underlying transport process over the dunes and time-scale of the dune evolution process.},

We argue that regardless of the ultimate outcome of the equal mobility debate, variability in local mean grain size across a reach can give rise to strong selective deposition even if locally equal mobility is satisfied exactly. We consider a system in which the sediment is arranged into locally well mixed zones (“patches”) whose mean grain size varies randomly across the reach. We assume that the shear stress is randomly distributed with a mean value near the critical value for the reach-averaged median size, that the variance in stress scales with the variance in grain size, and that the development of fine patches in areas of high shear stress is supply limited. The main controls on fining rate are then the ratio of mean stress to critical stress for the section-averaged mean grain size and the ratio of the patch standard deviation (assumed constant) to the standard deviation of patch means. In addition, in any system in which fining occurs by selective transport and deposition, the fining rate is strongly influenced by the spatial distribution of deposition rate.},

  abstract = {In this article we present a unique, detailed, basin-wide, morphological analysis of the Rhine, one of the world's larger rivers. The objectives of this study were to characterize the basin-scale morphodynamics of the Rhine River in the period 1991–2010 by quantifying the downstream fluxes of clay, silt, sand, gravel and cobbles from source to mouth and identifying the sources and sinks of these sediments using sediment budget analyses. From source to mouth, the Rhine traverses four sections with fundamentally different morphodynamic behaviour: the Alpine, impounded, free-flowing and delta section. Sediment fluxes are discontinuous, primarily because of the presence of a glacial lake trapping all sediments from upstream. The lake caused sediment fluxes to be discontinuous already before the Anthropocene. Today's sediment fluxes are strongly influenced by dredging and nourishment operations. From a global perspective, sediment fluxes in the river's headwaters are large, whereas sediment output from the Rhine towards the sea is small. A special feature of the Rhine is the fact that more sediment is transported in upstream direction from the sea into the delta than vice versa. On a basin-scale, nourishment represents the biggest source of gravel and cobbles, and tributaries the biggest source of clay, silt and sand. In the lower Rhine delta, additional large amounts of clay, silt and sand are supplied by the sea. Dredging represents a main sediment sink for all size fractions. For silt and clay, also floodplain deposition and deposition in ports represent major sinks. The Rhine is a typical example of a river in disequilibrium: large parts of the river are subject to erosion or sedimentation. In contrast to other rivers with erosion upstream and deposition downstream, the Rhine has net deposition upstream and net erosion downstream. Although human interventions contributed to the disequilibrium, the pristine Rhine already was in a state of disequilibrium. Even today, natural factors determine the location of the main sedimentation areas. The budget analysis shows that the behaviour of the clay/silt, sand and gravel/cobble fractions strongly differ from each other. A particularity is that in many reaches gravel is deposited, whereas simultaneously sand is being eroded. The budget analysis also shows that sediment dynamics in rivers are much higher than is suggested by echosoundings or transport measurements. This study provides valuable insights into the basin-scale morphodynamics of the Rhine, helps to see smaller-scale studies of parts of the Rhine Basin in a correct perspective, provides a good data basis to improve numerical prediction models, and helps to optimize nourishment, dredging and monitoring strategies in the Rhine. Furthermore, the Rhine represents an excellent reference case for other large river systems for which less data are available. Knowledge gaps of supra-regional importance identified in this study relate to (A) the fundamental disequilibrium of large river systems, (B) the effect of natural and human factors on the future morphodynamic development of the large river systems, (C) the morphodynamic role of sand in gravel-bed rivers and (D) the long-term effects of sediment nourishment.},

  abstract = {Abstract An extended period numerical integration of a baroclinic primitive equation model has been made for the simulation and the study of the dynamics of the atmosphere's general circulation. The solution corresponding to external gravitational propagation is filtered by requiring the vertically integrated divergence to vanish identically. The vertical structure permits as dependent variables the horizontal wind at two internal levels and a single temperature, with the static stability entering as a parameter. The incoming radiation is a function of latitude only corresponding to the annual mean, and the outgoing radiation is taken to be a function of the local temperature. With the requirement for thermal equilibrium, the domain mean temperature is specified as a parameter. The role of condensation is taken into account only as it effectively reduces the static stability. All other external sources and sinks of heat are assumed to balance each other locally, and are thus omitted. The kinematics are that of a fluid on a sphere bounded by smooth zonal walls at the equator and at approximately 64° latitude. The dissipative sinks are provided by: (a) surface stresses proportional through a drag coefficient to the square of the surface wind which is suitably extrapolated from above, (b) internal convective stresses proportional to the vertical wind shear, and (c) lateral diffusion of momentum and heat through an exchange coefficient which depends on the local horizontal rate of strain—a horizontal length scale entering as the governing parameter. For a given specification of the parameters, an integration for 60 days has been made from initial conditions where random temperature disturbances have been superimposed on a zonally symmetric regime which is baroclinically unstable according to linear theory. This experiment not only displays the scale selective character of baroclinic instability, yielding zonal wave number 5 to 6, but also predicts an index or energy cycle. The period of this cycle is 11 to 12 days for the first 40 days of the experiment, then lengthening to 17 days while diminishing in amplitude during the latter part. The resulting mean zonal velocity profile is in good qualitative agreement with observation, but too intense, presumably because the effective static stability parameter is taken too large. Furthermore this profile is found to be no more than 5 percent super-geostrophic poleward of the angular momentum maximum and no more than 2 percent sub-geostrophic equatorward. The total zonal angular momentum remains constant to within 2 percent irrespective of the phase of the index cycle. This balance is controlled by the surface wind distribution which agrees quite well with observation. The poleward transport is mainly accomplished by the large-scale eddies, whereas the internal vertical flux is predominantly a transfer of the earth's angular momentum by the meridional circulation. The poleward heat transport is primarily accomplished by a Hadley circulation at low latitudes but by the large-scale horizontal eddies in mid-latitudes, where a Ferrel circulation tends to compensate through an equatorward flux. This compensation at mid-latitudes by an indirect meridional circulation is also quite evident, in the potential-kinetic energy transformations. Comparison of the momentum and heat transfer with observed data when available shows reasonably good quantitative agreement. The lateral transfer of momentum and heat by the non-linear diffusion, which parametrically is supposed to simulate the action of motions of sub-grid scale, accounts for a significant portion of the total eddy transfer. Although no direct comparison with the corresponding transfer in the real atmosphere is available, intuitively our small-scale diffusion appears to play too large a role. A diagnosis is made of the transformations among the baratropic and baroclinic parts of the kinetic energy as well as the zonal mean and zonal perturbation parts of the available potential and kinetic energy. This reveals the dominant paths that the energy passes through from source to ultimate sinks and the processes responsible for these transformations. It is found that the partitioning of dissipation by the energy components may differ considerably from estimates made from observation.},

Research since the 1980s has greatly advanced and matured our knowledge on the formation and behavior of river bars, thanks to field work, laboratory experiments, theoretical analyses, and numerical modelling by several research groups. However, this knowledge is not easily accessible to design engineers, river managers, and ecologists who need to apply it. This is mainly due to confusing differences in terminology as well as to difficult mathematical theories. Moreover, existing scientific publications generally focus on specific aspects, so an overall review of the findings and their applications is still lacking. In many cases, the knowledge achieved so far would allow minimizing hard engineering interventions and thus obtaining more natural rivers. We present an integrated review of the major findings of river bar studies. Our aim is to provide accessible state-of-the-art knowledge for nature-based bar management and successful river training and river restoration. To this end we review the results from analytical, numerical, experimental, and field studies, explain the background of bar theories, and discuss applications in river engineering and river restoration.},

  abstract = {This paper contains a historical overview of 2D and 3D hydrodynamic modelling in the Netherlands from the 1960s till now. It started in the 1960s with two-dimensional (depth-averaged) shallow sea modelling for practical applications of the Dutch government. The most important application was the Dutch ‘Delta works’ project, which was initiated after the February 1953 flood disaster in the Netherlands. In the late 1980s, three-dimensional shallow water modelling in the Netherlands started due of the advance in computing power. This was also needed for 3D water quality modelling. Two large software suites have been developed for modelling of shallow water flows in the Netherlands, namely Simona and Delft3D. These integrated systems contain software for modelling of hydrodynamics, water quality, morphology and waves. In this paper, we focus on hydrodynamic modelling. In literature, a lot of applications of Delft3D and Simona have been described. However, in none of these papers, the key features of the underlying hydrodynamic numerical method have been described, which have resulted into a good performance with respect to robustness, accuracy and computational efficiency. This paper therefore summarizes ‘proven technology’ in shallow water modelling with Simona and Delft3D that has been applied in the past decades in the Netherlands and abroad. From the 1960s till now, the hydrodynamic modelling in the Netherlands has been based on structured grids. In 2011, a transition started in the Netherlands towards unstructured modelling for shallow water flows, which will be discussed as well.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulation of fluvial morphodynamic processes can identify important dynamics at time and space scales difficult to observe in the field. However, simulations involving large spatial scales and/or the long timescales characteristic of morphodynamic processes are often untenable because of long computation times. The morphological acceleration factor (morfac) applies a scalar multiplier to the sediment continuity equation, and is often applied in morphodynamic simulations to reduce computational time. Although the use of morfac in coastal simulations is relatively common, its applicability in field-scale fluvial models is generally confined to steady-flow simulations over reach-scale spatial domains. Here we explore the viability of using morfac to simulate large-scale, long-term morphodynamics in a gravel-bed river. We use Delft3D to simulate a 60-d period with a significant discharge event in the Nooksack River, Washington. We systematically adjust morfac values (ranging from 5 to 50) to compare with a baseline condition of no acceleration. Model results suggest that morfac-based modification of the inflow hydrograph time-series reduces peak flow magnitudes and flood wave celerities. Higher morfac values result in greater flood-wave attenuation and lower celerity, reducing the simulated morphological impact at locations farther downstream. In general, relative error compared to the model baseline increases farther downstream because of the altered flood-wave propagation. However, error analysis also shows a positive relationship with channel slope and a negative relationship with channel width; hence, errors increase in the steeper, confined reaches of the upper part of the domain. Even for the lowest morfac values absolute cumulative volume change errors are on the order of 10%, indicating that the use of morfac in fluvial simulations is best restricted to short-term and/or smaller-scale modeling efforts. Wider channel sections with lower gradients are shown to produce lower morfac-related errors. Therefore, morphological acceleration as examined here is potentially more appropriate for limited reaches rather than large-scale domains.},

  abstract = {Tidal sandbanks are large-scale bed features present in many shallow shelf seas. Here we investigate the effect of nonuniform sediment on their dynamics, with a particular aim to explain observed surficial grain size variations over tidal sandbanks from a process-based modeling perspective. To this end, we use a linear stability analysis that describes the positive feedback mechanism between hydrodynamics, sediment, and the seabed responsible for sandbank formation on a horizontal shelf. In this model the sediment transport and bed evolution modules are extended by introducing an active layer and a bimodal sediment mixture. We include a dynamic hiding/exposure description of sediment transport, enhancing the transport of coarse grains and inhibiting the transport of finer grains. The model results show that for symmetrical tidal conditions, coarse grains tend to accumulate at the bank crests. Moreover, the growth rates of the perturbations increase compared to the case of uniform sediment, while the preferred wavelength and bank orientation remain unchanged. For asymmetrical tidal conditions we find a spatial phase shift between topography and the mean grain size fraction, indicating an accumulation of coarse grains on the lee side of the bank. The model results qualitatively agree with observations from banks on the Belgian continental shelf.},

Because of their dynamic behaviour, unravelling the physical processes behind the growth of these bed forms is of particular interest to science and offshore industries. Various modelling efforts have given a good description of the initial stages of sand wave formation by adopting a linear stability analysis on the coupled system of water movement and the sandy seabed. However, the physical processes causing sand waves to grow towards equilibrium are far from understood. We adopt a numerical shallow water model (Delft3D) to study the growth of sand waves towards a stable equilibrium. It is shown that both suspended load transport and tidal asymmetry reduce the equilibrium sand wave height. A residual current results in asymmetrical bed forms that migrate in the direction of the residual current. The combination of suspended load transport and tidal asymmetry results in predicted equilibrium wave heights comparable to wave heights found in the field.},

The currently accepted view is that they are steady only if the width-to-depth ratio is at the value of resonance or if the bars are forced by a steady local perturbation. Experimental observations, however, show that steady bars are also present in cases of migrating bars without permanent forcings. The companion paper by Crosato  \&  Desta (2009) reviews these experimental observations and presents a numerical analysis using a 2D depth-averaged morphological model. Here we explain the occurrence of steady bars using a 2D linear stability analysis. The temporal growth rate of steady bars is zero under constant conditions, but is found to become positive if the conditions exhibit small temporal fluctuations. These fluctuations could result from discharge variations or the mere presence of migrating alternate bars. Since steady bars are seen as a prerequisite to explain meandering of alluvial rivers, these findings imply that neither resonant width-to-depth ratios nor steady local perturbations are necessary conditions for the onset of river meandering.},

LTDs split the river in a main channel and a bank-connected side channel with a sill at the entrance. In the present study, a physical scale model with mobile bed was used to study morphological patterns and discharge division in the entrance region of such a side channel. Alternative geometric designs of the sill are tested to investigate the controls on the diversion of water and sediment into the side channel. After reaching a morphodynamic equilibrium, two bar features were observed in the side channel under low flow conditions. An inner-bend depositional bar emerged against the LTD, resembling depositional bars observed in sharp river bends. A second bar occurred in the most upstream part of the side channel, next to the sill, induced by divergence of the flow by widening of the channel and an increasing flow depth after the sill, hence defined as a divergence bar. The morphologically most active system in the side channel emerges for the configuration in which the sill height decreases in downstream direction. For such a geometry, the sediment that settles during low flow is largely eroded during high flow, reducing maintenance needs. A qualitative comparison based on a lab experiment mimicking field conditions demonstrates the realism of the experiments.},

  abstract = {Abstract As dunes and larger-scale bed forms such as bars coexist in rivers, the question arises whether dune dynamics are influenced by interaction with the underlying bed topography. The present study aims to establish the degree to which dune characteristics in two and three dimensions are influenced by an underlying topography dominated by non-migrating bars. As a case study, a 20 km stretch in the Waal River in the Netherlands is selected, which represents a sand-bed lowland river. At this location, longitudinal training dams (LTDs) have recently been constructed to ensure sufficient navigation depth during periods with low water levels, and to reduce flood risk. By using data covering 2-year-long periods before and after LTD construction, the robustness of the results is investigated. Before LTD construction, dune characteristics show large variability both spatially and temporally, with dunes being longer, lower, less steep and having a lower lee side angle when they are located on bar tops. The correlation between dune characteristics and the underlying bed topography is disrupted by unsteady conditions for which the dunes are in a state of transition. The bar pattern causes tilting of dune crest lines, which may result from a transverse gradient in bedload sediment transport. As a result of LTD construction, the hydraulic and morphological conditions have changed significantly. Despite this, the main conclusions still hold, which strengthens the validity of the results. ©2020 The Authors. Earth Surface Processes and Landforms published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

  abstract = {An engineered alluvial river (i.e., a fixed-width channel) has constrained planform but is free to adjust channel slope and bed surface texture. These features are subject to controls: the hydrograph, sediment flux, and downstream base level. If the controls are sustained (or change slowly relative to the timescale of channel response), the channel ultimately achieves an equilibrium (or quasi-equilibrium) state. For brevity, we use the term “quasi-equilibrium” as a shorthand for both states. This quasi-equilibrium state is characterized by quasi-static and dynamic components, which define the characteristic timescale at which the dynamics of bed level average out. Although analytical models of quasi-equilibrium channel geometry in quasi-normal flow segments exist, rapid methods for determining the quasi-equilibrium geometry in backwater-dominated segments are still lacking. We show that, irrespective of its dynamics, the bed slope of a backwater or quasi-normal flow segment can be approximated as quasi-static (i.e., the static slope approximation). This approximation enables us to derive a rapid numerical space-marching solution of the quasi-static component for quasi-equilibrium channel geometry in both backwater and quasi-normal flow segments. A space-marching method means that the solution is found by stepping through space without the necessity of computing the transient phase. An additional numerical time stepping model describes the dynamic component of the quasi-equilibrium channel geometry. Tests of the two models against a backwater-Exner model confirm their validity. Our analysis validates previous studies in showing that the flow duration curve determines the quasi-static equilibrium profile, whereas the flow rate sequence governs the dynamic fluctuations.},

  abstract = {Abstract Side channel construction is a common intervention applied to increase a river's conveyance capacity and to increase its ecological value. Past modelling efforts suggest two mechanisms affecting the morphodynamic change of a side channel: (1) a difference in channel slope between the side channel and the main channel and (2) bend flow just upstream of the bifurcation. The objective of this paper was to assess the conditions under which side channels generally aggrade or degrade and to assess the characteristic timescales of the associated morphological change. We use a one-dimensional bifurcation model to predict the development of side channel systems and the characteristic timescale for a wide range of conditions. We then compare these results to multitemporal aerial images of four side channel systems. We consider the following mechanisms at the bifurcation to be important for side channel development: sediment diversion due to the bifurcation angle, sediment diversion due to the transverse bed slope, partitioning of suspended load, mixed sediment processes such as sorting at the bifurcation, bank erosion, deposition due to vegetation, and floodplain sedimentation. There are limitations to using a one-dimensional numerical model as it can only account for these mechanisms in a parametrized manner, but the model reproduces general behaviour of the natural side channels until floodplain-forming processes become important. The main result is a set of stability diagrams with key model parameters that can be used to assess the development of a side channel system and the associated timescale, which will aid in the future design and maintenance of side channel systems. ©  2017 The Authors.

Sediment fall velocity is a fundamental parameter in the modeling and interpretation of fluviatile and coastal deposition. The equation applies to the entire range of viscous to turbulent conditions, and its simple explicit form makes it easy to use in computer models and other applications in sedimentology, geomorphology, and engineering. The equation is derived from dimensional analysis and converges on Stokes' law for small grains and a constant drag coefficient for large grains. Its two physically interpretable parameters are easily adjusted for shape effects or for the use of sieve diameter rather than nominal grain diameter. It gives a close fit to published and new experimental data for both quartz sand and low-density materials, with no more error than previous equations of more complicated form.}},

Tidal time means a time scale of calculation larger than that defining turbulence, but much smaller than a tidal period in order to correctly represent the tidal advection within a tidal period. The tidal dynamic equations are coupled to the conservation of salt equation through a salinity-density relationship, and the ocean boundary condition for salt is formulated in a manner which depends on the direction of flow at the entrance to the estuary. By specifying initial conditions, fresh water hydrographs, and tidal elevations at the ocean, it is possible to predict the time-varying salinity using this model. (Author)},

  abstract = {One of the fundamental units in fluvial systems is a bifurcation, where an existing channel splits into two. Diversions are a special class of asymmetric bifurcation, in which one of the channels after bifurcation continues along the original channel. Over the years, engineered diversions have been used for irrigation and navigational purposes. Interest in diversions has also been fueled owing to their similarity with naturally occurring asymmetric bifurcations. Thus, dynamics of the flow and distribution of sediment between the two bifurcating channels at a diversion have been active areas of interest to river engineers for almost 100\&nbsp;years, when a series of experiments showed that the ratio of bed load entering the two channels after a diversion did not mirror the ratio of the water flowing into the two channels. This nonlinear phenomenon is often referred to as the Bulle Effect. Subsequently, other experimental studies corroborated these findings and expanded the parameter space upon which the phenomenon depends. Interest in diversions has been rekindled recently because of their possible use to divert sediment (and water) for mitigating land loss at river deltas. This paper charts the history of studies on river diversions, bringing together studies on the Bulle Effect spanning almost a century. The objective of is to evaluate the state of art in the field and draw some holistic conclusions in order to shed light on the fundamental mechanism driving the nonlinear phenomenon of the Bulle Effect and its implications for the design of sediment and water diversions for reclamation of land in sediment-starved deltas.},

  abstract = {Abstract A human-made entrance to a side channel separated from the river by a longitudinal training dam can be considered a new, emergent type of river bifurcation. To understand the processes controlling the diversion of flow and sediment toward the side channel at such bifurcations, a comprehensive field monitoring program was performed in the Waal River, which is the main branch of the Rhine River in the Netherlands. Local processes govern the flow field in the bifurcation region. The angle between the main river flow and the flow into the side channel increases with decreasing lateral and longitudinal distance to the bifurcation point, which corresponds to the head of the training dam. The general flow pattern can be well reproduced with a uniform depth, potential flow model consisting of a superposition of main channel flow and lateral outflow. For submerged flow conditions over the sill, the side channel hydraulic conditions influence the exchange processes, yet free flow side weir theory describes the flow field at this bifurcation type qualitatively well. The vertical flow structure in the side channel, which governs the sediment exchange between the main channel and the side channel, is steered by the geometrical details of the sill. The presence of the sill structure is key to controlling the morphological stability of this type of bifurcation given its primary influence on bed load sediment import and exerts an indirect impact on suspended sediment exchange.},

The result of installation of the submerged vane technology demonstrated its effectiveness in sediment management and motivated its further use as a solution to problems of erosion, scour and meander evolution, which are common occurrence in the rivers of the country. Since this 1991 installation, more than 18 projects have been completed and the technical effectiveness of the system has been improved. Compared to traditional solutions, the results demonstrate beneficial economic impacts due to shorter execution times, reduction in annual maintenance costs, and diminished environmental impacts. Characteristics of design and construction and results obtained from five projects are described that are representative of the diversity of conditions and difficulties for the application of this technology in Colombia.

In this study, we derive a binary packing formula by introducing the available porosity for finer sediment particles. The binary packing problem using natural fluvial sediment with various diameter ratios could be reproduced using the proposed formula. We apply this new model to a scenario with mixed-size sediments to calculate gravel-bed porosity. To validate the model, we compare model results to those obtained via an experiment using natural fluvial sediments. The present model exhibits good agreement with the measurements of the deposited sediment in gravel-bed rivers. Because the present model simulates the deposition process of sediment mixtures, it can be coupled with computational fluid dynamic and sediment transport models for predicting morphodynamics in gravel-bed rivers.},

  abstract = {Abstract This study suggests a stochastic Bayesian approach for calibrating and validating morphodynamic sediment transport models and for quantifying parametric uncertainties in order to alleviate limitations of conventional (manual, deterministic) calibration procedures. The applicability of our method is shown for a large-scale (11.0 km) and time-demanding (9.14 hr for the period 2002–2013) 2-D morphodynamic sediment transport model of the Lower River Salzach and for three most sensitive input parameters (critical Shields parameter, grain roughness, and grain size distribution). Since Bayesian methods require a significant number of simulation runs, this work proposes to construct a surrogate model, here with the arbitrary polynomial chaos technique. The surrogate model is constructed from a limited set of runs (n=20) of the full complex sediment transport model. Then, Monte Carlo-based techniques for Bayesian calibration are used with the surrogate model (105 realizations in 4 hr). The results demonstrate that following Bayesian principles and iterative Bayesian updating of the surrogate model (10 iterations) enables to identify the most probable ranges of the three calibration parameters. Model verification based on the maximum a posteriori parameter combination indicates that the surrogate model accurately replicates the morphodynamic behavior of the sediment transport model for both calibration (RMSE = 0.31 m) and validation (RMSE = 0.42 m). Furthermore, it is shown that the surrogate model is highly effective in lowering the total computational time for Bayesian calibration, validation, and uncertainty analysis. As a whole, this provides more realistic calibration and validation of morphodynamic sediment transport models with quantified uncertainty in less time compared to conventional calibration procedures.},

Usually, either an Eulerian or a Lagrangian frame of reference is employed in order to detect such features of the flow. However, the two frameworks detect structures that have different properties. Indeed, common Eulerian diagnostics (Hua-Klein and Okubo-Weiss criterion) employed in order to detect vortices do not always agree with Lagrangian diagnostics such as finite-time Lyapunov exponents. Besides, the former are Galilean-invariant whereas the latter is objective. However, both the Lagrangian and the Eulerian approaches to coherent structure detection must show some links under any inertial-frame. Compound channels flows have been accurately studied in the past, both from a Lagrangian and an Eulerian point of view. The features detected do not superimpose: Eulerian vortices do not coincide with barriers to transport. The missing link between the two approaches is here recovered thanks to a spectral analysis.},

Several approaches are presented, all being direct, that is non-iterative. The resulting bounds range from crude but simple estimates to accurate but sophisticated estimates that make limited use of information from the solution of the Riemann problem. Through a carefully chosen suite of test problems we asses our wave speed estimates against exact solutions and against previously proposed wave speed estimates. The results confirm that the derived theoretical bounds are actually so, from below and above, for minimal and maximal wave speeds respectively. The results also show that popular previously proposed estimates do not bound the true wave speeds in general. Applications in mind, but not pursued here, include (i) reliable implementation of the Courant condition to determine a stable time step in all explicit methods for hyperbolic equations; (ii) use in local time stepping algorithms and (iii) construction of HLL-type numerical fluxes for hyperbolic equations.},

  abstract = {SUMMARYSemi-implicit methods are known for being the basis of simple, efficient, accurate, and stable numerical algorithms for simulating a large variety of geophysical free-surface flows. Geophysical flows are typically characterized by having a small vertical scale as compared with their horizontal extents. Hence, the hydrostatic approximation often applies, and the free surface can be conveniently represented by a single-valued function of the horizontal coordinates. In the present investigation, semi-implicit methods are extended to complex free-surface flows that are governed by the full incompressible Navier–Stokes equations and are delimited by solid boundaries and arbitrarily shaped free-surfaces. The primary dependent variables are the velocity components and the pressure. Finite difference equations for momentum, and a finite volume discretization for continuity, are derived in such a fashion that, after simple manipulation, the resulting pressure equation yields a well-posed piecewise linear system from which both the pressure and the fluid volume within each computational cell are naturally derived. This system is efficiently solved by a nested Newton type iterative scheme, and the resulting fluid volumes are assured to be nonnegative and bounded from above by the available cell volumes. The time step size is not restricted by stability conditions dictated by surface wave speed, but can be freely chosen just to achieve the desired accuracy. Several examples illustrate the model applicability to a large range of complex free-surface flows and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

  abstract = {A spatially arbitrary high order, semi-implicit spectral discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme for the numerical solution of the shallow water equations on staggered control volumes is derived and discussed. The free surface elevation and the momentum are expressed in terms of the same polynomials that are used as basis, and as test functions. Each unknown is, however, defined on a different set of control volumes that are spatially staggered with respect to each other. A semi-implicit time integration yields a stable and efficient mass conservative algorithm. The use of a staggered mesh has the advantage that after substitution of the momentum equations into the mass conservation equation only one single block-penta-diagonal system must be solved for the new free surface location, which is a scalar quantity. Subsequently the new momentum components are directly obtained. The staggered semi-implicit approach makes the present DG scheme different from other published DG schemes. The sparse linear system of the resulting discrete wave equation for the free surface can be conveniently solved by a matrix-free GMRES algorithm. Furthermore, for the shallow water equations the proposed scheme can be written as a quadrature-free method, where all surface and volume integrals can be precomputed once and for all on the reference element and assembled into universal matrices and tensors. For the special case N=0 the proposed method reduces to a classical semi-implicit finite difference scheme. The proposed semi-implicit scheme is particularly well suited for low Froude number flows. The method is validated on some typical academic benchmark problems, using polynomial degrees of up to N=20.},

A recently developed nondestructive sampling technique allows the determination of bed material composition over vertical surfaces of the bed. This is particularly interesting for determining particle arrangement on the surface of and inside bed forms. Experiments were carried out using bimodal and trimodal sediment mixtures in two recirculating flumes. The development of surface coarsening was detected and measured at various stages of the process. Variations in the initial bed material composition brought very different responses in the bed geometry. The mobile armoring process was also strongly affected by bed material composition. The experimental procedures described in this work indicate a possible path to be followed for further experimental research on armoring processes.},

Study objectives included extending the available data for high shear stresses and defining a criterion for the critical armoring condition. A new experimental technique incorporating an adjustable sediment support table, which provided uniform flow and constant shear stress throughout an experiment, was used. A nonuniform sediment forms stable armor layers for a range of shear stresses, bounded by an upper limit beyond which all grains are indiscriminately in motion and armor layers cannot form. The limiting stable armor layer formed at the highest shear stress is called the critical armor layer and the shear stress the critical shear stress. The dimensionless critical shear stress depends on the ratio of the maximum and median particle sizes of the sediment, decreasing as the ratio increases. The median particle size of the critical armor layer is the maximum particle size divided by 1.8, equivalent to a geometric standard deviation of 1.5. Thus, the composition of the critical armor layer corresponds to a lower limit of a nonuniform material. Uniform sediments do not armor.},

For three periods of 9, 8 and 17 years sediment transport computations are made with two series of relationships between sediment transport (Qb) and discharge (Q) in which the condition of the armour layer is taken into account. These sediment-transport–discharge (Qb\&\#38;sol;Q) relationships are determined by local bed-load transport measurements in the Common Meuse. At the beginning and the end of the first period (1978–1987) and at the end of the second period (1987–1995) bed levels have been measured by soundings. By the analysis of the measured bed levels at the beginning and the end of the two periods the sediment transport along the Common Meuse is estimated. The same analysis was carried out for the combined period (1978–1995). The yearly mean sediment transport computed by these two methods are compared. The necessity of carrying out bed-load transport measurements at several locations in a cross-section and over the entire range of discharges is clearly shown. Attention is paid to the advantages and disadvantages of the two methods and the need for applying more than one method to compute sediment transport. Copyright 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

ABSTRACT = {Thirty one percent (31%) of the world \& rsquo;s coastline consists of sandy beaches and dunes that form a natural defense protecting the hinterland from flooding. A common measure to mitigate erosion along sandy beaches is the implementation of sand nourishments. The design and acceptance of such a mitigating measure require information on the expected evolution at time scales from storms to decades. Process-based morphodynamic models are increasingly applied, together with morphodynamic acceleration techniques, to obtain detailed information on this wide scale of ranges. This study shows that techniques for the acceleration of the morphological evolution can have a significant impact on the simulated evolution and dispersion of sandy interventions. A calibrated Delft3D model of the Sand Engine mega-nourishment is applied to compare different acceleration techniques, focusing on accuracy and computational times. Results show that acceleration techniques using representative (schematized) wave conditions are not capable of accurately reproducing the morphological response in the first two years. The best reproduction of the morphological behavior of the first five years is obtained by the brute force simulations. Applying input filtering and a compression factor provides similar accuracy yet with a factor five gain in computational cost. An attractive method for the medium to long time scales, which further reduces computational costs, is a method that uses representative wave conditions based on gross longshore transports, while showing similar results as the benchmark simulation. Erosional behavior is captured well in all considered techniques with variations in volumes of about 1 million m     3     after three decades. The spatio-temporal variability of the predicted alongshore and cross-shore distribution of the morphological evolution however have a strong dependency on the selected acceleration technique. A new technique, called  \& rsquo;brute force merged \& rsquo;, which incorporates the full variability of the wave climate, provides the optimal combination of phenomenological accuracy and computational efficiency (a factor of 20 faster than the benchmark brute force technique) at both the short and medium to long time scales. This approach, which combines realistic time series and the mormerge technique, provides an attractive and flexible method to efficiently predict the evolution of complex sandy interventions at time scales from hours to decades.},

  abstract = {In a channel with bed topography that does not vary in the downstream direction, a secondary circulation composed of outward flow at the surface and inward flow near the bottom extends across the entire width. If the curvature is constant, the cross-stream velocity component near the bed and the pattern of boundary shear stress can be estimated by assuming fluid accelerations to be small. Unfortunately, this procedure cannot be used in analyzing the flow through natural river meanders, or through channels with downstream constant bottom topography but with rapidly changing curvature. In these latter cases, effects arising from bed- and bank-induced momentum changes must be accounted for. Evidence for a substantial topographically induced alteration in the cross-stream flow pattern relative to that for the analogous constant bottom topography case is provided through new analyses of several sets of laboratory and field data. Shoaling over the point bar in the upstream part of the bend is shown to force the high-velocity core of the flow toward the pool. This is accomplished by a convective acceleration-caused decrease in the cross-stream water surface slope and a resulting dominance of the vertically averaged centrifugal force. The primary effect is a velocity component toward the outside or concave bank throughout the flow depth over the upstream, shallow part of the point bar and an outward component of boundary shear stress in this region. The channel curvature-induced inward component of boundary shear stress consequently is confined to 20 or 30\% of the channel width at the pool. Outward transfer of momentum over the point bar, as manifested by a rapid crossing of the high-velocity core from the inside bank to the outside one, contributes to an enhanced decrease in boundary shear stress along the convex side of the stream as the top of the bar is approached. Forces arising from topographically induced spatial accelerations are of the same order of magnitude as the downstream boundary shear stress and water surface slope force components, so they must be modeled as zero-order, not first- or second-order, effects.},

Three flood hazard maps for return periods of 10, 20 and 50 years are generated. The flood hazard modeling reveals that the flooded zone is more significant out of the left (West) bank than out of the right (East) bank of Atrato River. For the three return periods the maximum depth of water reached by the river and extent of flooding are estimated. Sensitivity analysis on roughness coefficient and peak discharge is performed. For 50 year return period (Q =3054 m3/s), water depth on the left and right bank of Atrato River is 3.7 m and 3.1 m, respectively. This information is useful in defining the minimum height of flood protection structures such as dikes to protect the area from flooding. The results can be useful for evacuation planning, estimation of damages and post flood recovery efforts.},

  abstract = {Kinematic and diffusion waves are reviewed prompted by the continuing controversy regarding their nature and applicability. Kinematic waves are shown to be nondiffusive, but to undergo change in shape due to nonlinearity. This latter feature gives kinematic waves the capability of steepening, eventually leading to the formation of the kinematic shock. Kinematic wave solutions using finite differences are shown to possess intrinsic amounts of numerical diffusion and dispersion. These numerical effects are artificial and tend to disappear as the grid size is refined, making the solution dependent on the choice of grid size. Kinematic wave theory can be improved by extending it to the realm of diffusion waves. In this way, the diffusion inherent in many practical runoff computations can be accounted for directly in the modeling, rather than as an afterthought. The use of a kinematic wave method is indicated for small catchments, in cases where it is possible to resolve the physical detail without compromising the deterministic nature of the model. Conversely, the unit hydrograph is advocated for midsize catchments, where the kinematic wave method may prove difficult to implement. The dynamic extension to kinematic and diffusion models shows promise, particularly for modeling channel and flow conditions in which the Vedernikov number is substantially different from zero.},

Situated in a densely populated and developed delta, the river and its infrastructure fulfil important societal functions: safety against flooding, inland waterways, nature, freshwater supply, and agriculture. Programs to improve individual functions increasingly lead to conflicts with other functions and therefore call for an integrated approach. This paper reviews the history of the Dutch Rhine and documents the sectoral improvement programs in recent decades, explaining adverse effects such as the large-scale bed degradation at rates of up to 4 cm per year. The lessons from the past are used to propose avenues for future integrated and sustainable river training and river management, arguing that mitigating adverse effects while maintaining societal functions requires a combination of recurrent sediment management measures and extensive structural measures that may change the layout of the river system.},

  abstract = {Braided rivers have complicated and dynamic bar patterns, which are challenging to fully understand and to predict both qualitatively and quantitatively. Linear theory ignores nonlinear processes that dominate fully developed bars, whereas natural river patterns are determined by the combined effects of boundary conditions, initial conditions such as planimetric forcing by fixed banks and the physical processes. Here we determine the capability of a state-of-the-art physics-based morphological model to reproduce morphology and dynamics characteristic of braided rivers and determine the model sensitivity to generally used constitutive relations for flow and sediment transport. We use the 2-D depth-averaged morphodynamic model Delft3D, which includes the necessary spiral flow and bed slope effects on morphology. We present idealized scenarios with the smallest possible number of enforced details in the planform and boundary conditions in order to allow free development of bars driven by the physical processes in the model. We analyze bar and channel shapes and dynamics quantified by a number of complementary metrics and compare these with imagery, field data captured in empirical relations, flume experiments, and predictions by linear analyses. The results show that the chosen set of boundary conditions and physics in the numerical model is sufficient to produce many morphological characteristics and dynamics of a braided river but insufficient for long-term modeling. Initially, braiding intensity with low-amplitude bars is high in agreement with linear analysis. In a second stage when bars merge, split, and increase amplitude up to the water surface, the shape, size, and dynamics of individual bars compare well to those in natural rivers. However, long-term modeling results in a reduction of bar and channel dynamics and formation of exaggerated bar height and length. This suggests that additional processes, such as physics-based bank erosion, or enforced fluctuations in boundary conditions, such as spatial-temporal discharge variation, are necessary for the simulation of a dynamic equilibrium river. The most important outcome is that the modeled pattern of bars and channels is highly sensitive to the constitutive relation for bed slope effects that is used in many morphological models. Regardless of this sensitivity and present model limitations of many models, this study shows that physics-based modeling of sand-bed braided improves our understanding and prediction of morphological patterns and dynamics in sand-bed braided rivers.},

A common measure to mitigate erosion along sandy beaches is the implementation of sand nourishments. The design and acceptance of such a mitigating measure require information on the expected evolution at time scales from storms to decades. Process-based morphodynamic models are increasingly applied, together with morphodynamic acceleration techniques, to obtain detailed information on this wide scale of ranges. This study shows that techniques for the acceleration of the morphological evolution can have a significant impact on the simulated evolution and dispersion of sandy interventions. A calibrated Delft3D model of the Sand Engine mega-nourishment is applied to compare different acceleration techniques, focusing on accuracy and computational times. Results show that acceleration techniques using representative (schematized) wave conditions are not capable of accurately reproducing the morphological response in the first two years. The best reproduction of the morphological behavior of the first five years is obtained by the brute force simulations. Applying input filtering and a compression factor provides similar accuracy yet with a factor five gain in computational cost. An attractive method for the medium to long time scales, which further reduces computational costs, is a method that uses representative wave conditions based on gross longshore transports, while showing similar results as the benchmark simulation. Erosional behavior is captured well in all considered techniques with variations in volumes of about 1 million m     3     after three decades. The spatio-temporal variability of the predicted alongshore and cross-shore distribution of the morphological evolution however have a strong dependency on the selected acceleration technique. A new technique, called  \& rsquo;brute force merged \& rsquo;, which incorporates the full variability of the wave climate, provides the optimal combination of phenomenological accuracy and computational efficiency (a factor of 20 faster than the benchmark brute force technique) at both the short and medium to long time scales. This approach, which combines realistic time series and the mormerge technique, provides an attractive and flexible method to efficiently predict the evolution of complex sandy interventions at time scales from hours to decades.},

  abstract = {In a channel with bed topography that does not vary in the downstream direction, a secondary circulation composed of outward flow at the surface and inward flow near the bottom extends across the entire width. If the curvature is constant, the cross-stream velocity component near the bed and the pattern of boundary shear stress can be estimated by assuming fluid accelerations to be small. Unfortunately, this procedure cannot be used in analyzing the flow through natural river meanders, or through channels with downstream constant bottom topography but with rapidly changing curvature. In these latter cases, effects arising from bed- and bank-induced momentum changes must be accounted for. Evidence for a substantial topographically induced alteration in the cross-stream flow pattern relative to that for the analogous constant bottom topography case is provided through new analyses of several sets of laboratory and field data. Shoaling over the point bar in the upstream part of the bend is shown to force the high-velocity core of the flow toward the pool. This is accomplished by a convective acceleration-caused decrease in the cross-stream water surface slope and a resulting dominance of the vertically averaged centrifugal force. The primary effect is a velocity component toward the outside or concave bank throughout the flow depth over the upstream, shallow part of the point bar and an outward component of boundary shear stress in this region. The channel curvature-induced inward component of boundary shear stress consequently is confined to 20 or 30\% of the channel width at the pool. Outward transfer of momentum over the point bar, as manifested by a rapid crossing of the high-velocity core from the inside bank to the outside one, contributes to an enhanced decrease in boundary shear stress along the convex side of the stream as the top of the bar is approached. Forces arising from topographically induced spatial accelerations are of the same order of magnitude as the downstream boundary shear stress and water surface slope force components, so they must be modeled as zero-order, not first- or second-order, effects.},

  abstract = {The flood hazard caused by Atrato River in Quibdó, northwest of Colombia is assessed using statistical modeling techniques (Gumbel and GRADEX), hydraulic modeling with HEC-RAS and the Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Three flood hazard maps for return periods of 10, 20 and 50 years are generated. The flood hazard modeling reveals that the flooded zone is more significant out of the left (West) bank than out of the right (East) bank of Atrato River. For the three return periods the maximum depth of water reached by the river and extent of flooding are estimated. Sensitivity analysis on roughness coefficient and peak discharge is performed. For 50 year return period (Q =3054 m3/s), water depth on the left and right bank of Atrato River is 3.7 m and 3.1 m, respectively. This information is useful in defining the minimum height of flood protection structures such as dikes to protect the area from flooding. The results can be useful for evacuation planning, estimation of damages and post flood recovery efforts.},

  abstract = {Kinematic and diffusion waves are reviewed prompted by the continuing controversy regarding their nature and applicability. Kinematic waves are shown to be nondiffusive, but to undergo change in shape due to nonlinearity. This latter feature gives kinematic waves the capability of steepening, eventually leading to the formation of the kinematic shock. Kinematic wave solutions using finite differences are shown to possess intrinsic amounts of numerical diffusion and dispersion. These numerical effects are artificial and tend to disappear as the grid size is refined, making the solution dependent on the choice of grid size. Kinematic wave theory can be improved by extending it to the realm of diffusion waves. In this way, the diffusion inherent in many practical runoff computations can be accounted for directly in the modeling, rather than as an afterthought. The use of a kinematic wave method is indicated for small catchments, in cases where it is possible to resolve the physical detail without compromising the deterministic nature of the model. Conversely, the unit hydrograph is advocated for midsize catchments, where the kinematic wave method may prove difficult to implement. The dynamic extension to kinematic and diffusion models shows promise, particularly for modeling channel and flow conditions in which the Vedernikov number is substantially different from zero.},

  abstract = {Although porosity is a key property of sediment mixtures, little is known of the natural variations in porosity in fluvial systems. Porosity predictors can help to generate such information. The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of porosity predictors for fluvial sand-gravel mixtures. In order to do so, porosity measurements were done in the Rhine River, using a diving bell to allow undisturbed sampling under water. In addition, laboratory experiments were conducted, and porosity data from literature were reanalyzed. Measured porosity values range from 0.06 to 0.48. Our study shows that predictors based on the median grain size, the deviation from the Fuller curve, or the sediment standard deviation are unable to reproduce the observed variation in porosity. Predictors based on the entire grain size distribution perform better but are biased and have a large prediction error. This suggests that they do not account correctly for the grain size effect on porosity. On the other hand, parameters such as grain shape and the mechanism of deposition probably also have a distinct influence on porosity. Slightly more accurate predictions can be obtained with tailor-made predictors for the river under interest. Multivariate regression analysis on the Rhine data set produced a predictor with two independent parameters: the sediment standard deviation and the number of grains smaller than 0.5 mm, representing grain mixing effects and adhesion effects, respectively. Despite the shortcomings, porosity predictors provide valuable insights in the spatial variation in porosity, which is demonstrated in a case study for the Rhine River.},

  abstract = {To improve the accuracy and the efficiency of morphodynamic simulations, we present a subgrid based approach for a morphodynamic model. This approach is well suited for areas characterized by sub-critical flow, like in estuaries, coastal areas and in low land rivers. This new method uses a different grid resolution to compute the hydrodynamics and the morphodynamics. The hydrodynamic computations are carried out with a subgrid based, two-dimensional, depth-averaged model. This model uses a coarse computational grid in combination with a subgrid. The subgrid contains high resolution bathymetry and roughness information to compute volumes, friction and advection. The morphodynamic computations are carried out entirely on a high resolution grid, the bed grid. It is key to find a link between the information defined on the different grids in order to guaranty the feedback between the hydrodynamics and the morphodynamics. This link is made by using a new physics-based interpolation method. The method interpolates water levels and velocities from the coarse grid to the high resolution bed grid. The morphodynamic solution improves significantly when using the subgrid based method compared to a full coarse grid approach. The Exner equation is discretised with an upwind method based on the direction of the bed celerity. This ensures a stable solution for the Exner equation. By means of three examples, it is shown that the subgrid based approach offers a significant improvement at a minimal computational cost.},

  abstract = {Bedrock rivers exert a critical control over landscape evolution, yet little is known about the sediment transport processes that affect their incision. We present theoretical analyses and field data that demonstrate how grain entrainment, translation and deposition are affected by the degree of sediment cover in a bedrock channel. Theoretical considerations of grain entrainment mechanics and sediment continuity each demonstrate that areas of exposed bedrock and thin sediment depths cause sediment transport to be size-independent, albeit excluding extreme grain sizes. We report gravel and cobble magnetic tracer data from three rivers with contrasting sediment cover: the bedrock River Calder (20\% cover), the bedrock South Fork Eel River (80\%) and the alluvial Allt Dubhaig (100\%). These data sets show that: 1) transport distances in the River Calder are controlled by sediment patch location, whereas in the other rivers transport distances are described by gamma distributions representing local dispersion; 2) River Calder transport distances are size-independent across all recorded shear stresses, whereas the other rivers display size-selectivity; 3) River Calder tracers are entrained at a dimensionless shear stress of 0.038, which is relatively low compared to alluvial rivers; and, 4) virtual grain velocities in the River Calder are higher than in a comparable reach of the Allt Dubhaig. These contrasts result from differences in the thicknesses and spatial distribution of sediment in the three rivers, and support the theoretical analysis. Sediment processes in bedrock rivers systematically vary along a continuum between bedrock and alluvial end-members.},

The aim of this study is to improve computational efficiency and optimize the balance between the quantity of grids used in and the simulation accuracy of 2D hydrodynamic models. Local mesh refinement and a local time stepping (LTS) strategy were used to address this aim. The implementation of the LTS algorithm on a 2D shallow-water dynamic model was investigated using the finite volume method on unstructured meshes. The model performance was evaluated using three canonical test cases, which discussed the influential factors and the adaptive conditions of the algorithm. The results of the numerical tests show that the LTS method improved the computational efficiency and fulfilled mass conservation and solution accuracy constraints. Speedup ratios of between 1.3 and 2.1 were obtained. The LTS scheme was used for navigable flow simulation of the river reach between the Three Gorges and Gezhouba Dams. This showed that the LTS scheme is effective for real complex applications and long simulations and can meet the required accuracy. An analysis of the influence of the mesh refinement on the speedup was conducted. Coarse and refined mesh proportions and mesh scales observably affected the acceleration effect of the LTS algorithm. Smaller proportions of refined mesh resulted in higher speedup ratios. Acceleration was the most obvious when mesh scale differences were large. These results provide technical guidelines for reducing computational time for 2D hydrodynamic models on non-uniform unstructured grids.},

We explain these by comparing numerical simulations for an idealized confluence with aerial photographs of several river confluences where color differences express the pattern of density differences at the surface. We analyzed numerical simulations of the Rio Negro \& ndash;Solim \& otilde;es confluence near Manaus, Brazil, in more detail. The numerical model of the idealized confluence showed that the dense water flowed under the light water and the light water over the dense water in a spiraling motion, distorting the interface between the two waters. The horizontal part of this interface moves upwards in downstream direction. Constraining of the spiraling motion in a narrow river downstream of the confluence can cause local up- and downwelling near the banks. A mixing layer can develop when the flow velocities of the two tributaries differ, but strong spiraling motion due to the density differences can suppress this development. The aerial photographs and all numerical simulations showed similar density patterns at the water surface. Even small density differences can have a significant impact and hence need to be considered when analyzing and modeling 3D flow at confluences.},

  abstract = {Abstract Recent studies reveal that low-slope bedrock reaches (bedrock surface slope milder than ~5 m/km) are more common than previously thought and can be found in engineered rivers and densely populated deltas. Here we present a novel formulation of alluvial morphodynamics of low-slope bedrock rivers transporting nonuniform bed material that accounts for the nonuniformity of the sediment size and the presence of small scale bedforms such as dunes and can thus be of aid to solve management/restoration problems in low-slope bedrock rivers. The formulation is implemented in a one-dimensional morphodynamic model. Numerical results are compared with laboratory experiments on equilibrium bedrock reaches downstream of stable alluvial-bedrock transitions. The differences between experimental and numerical results are comparable with those obtained in the alluvial case. Model applications simulate (1) bedrock reaches with a stable bedrock-alluvial transitions, (2) an alluvial-bedrock transition subject to sea level rise, and (3) steep bedrock reaches. Upstream of a stable bedrock-alluvial transition the flow decelerates in the streamwise direction with the formation of a stable pattern of downstream coarsening of bed surface sediment. In response to sea level rise, alluvial-bedrock transitions migrate downstream and bedrock-alluvial transitions migrate upstream. Opposite migration directions are expected in the case of sea level fall. When applied to steep channels, the model predicts gradual alluviation, but it fails to reproduce runaway alluviation.},

  abstract     = {A common approach used to mitigate riverbank erosion and maintain watercourse alignments has been through the application of riprap or larger, more stable particles to channel boundaries along reaches of interest. However, very often, these large particles become dislodged from their intended locations (failed erosion measures), becoming part of the bed material composition. In natural systems, large immobile sediments or boulders can also be found, which are often sourced from glacial erratics or colluvial inputs with different spacing and arrangements among them. In lower gradient gravel-bed channels, the impacts that large clasts may impart on river morphologies are uncertain and are studied in this paper. This paper utilizes laboratory experiments to evaluate the effects that varying spacing of large immobile particles in a gravel-bed channel have on sediment transport and bed morphology. The laboratory experiments consist of a series of test cases with a varying spacing of large immobile particles and one base case with no large immobile particles present. In each case, the flume bed was composed of a poorly sorted gravel mixture with a bimodal distribution of sand and gravel meant to be representative of a natural gravel-bed channel. The results of the test cases demonstrated that at a low spacing of large immobile particles, the transported material and the bed material both became coarser. At a medium spacing of large immobile particles, the bed material size and erosion reached a maximum, and the coarser bed material was transported at approximately the same rate as the finer material. Finally, at a high spacing of large immobile particles, the size of the transported material and bed material sizes were similar to that of the base case, and the sediment transport also had the strongest clockwise hysteresis trend, which ultimately led to a net erosion of the gravel-bed channel.},

  abstract     = {AbstractBathymetric measurements show that a deep, subtidal channel in San Pablo Bay, California, has consistently narrowed during the past 150 years. This raises general questions on the seasonal and intertidal morphodynamic processes acting at the subtidal channel-shoal interface. The current work addresses these questions using a process-based morphodynamic model (Delft3D). Model results reveal considerable morphodynamic activity during a tidal cycle. Deposition on the channel margin is largest during flooding of the shoals. Erosion rates (mainly occuring during ebb) remain relatively small, so that net accretion occurs on much of the channel margin. A remarkable finding is that locally generated wind waves are responsible for shoal extension and depositional channel narrowing. High suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in the channel is a critical factor. Apart from sediment supply during high river flow, wind waves suspending sediment on the shoals cause high SSC levels in the channel at ebb. Sensitivity analysis shows that wind direction even determines the location of channel margin accretion. Fluvial sediment supply is another cause of high SSC in the channel. Density currents, 3-D circulation flows, sea level rise, or varied sediment characteristics only have a limited effect on the erosion and sedimentation patterns. A 30 year forecast shows that deeper shoals and decreasing fluvial sediment supply lower SSC levels in the channel, limit channel margin accretion, and even lead to net channel margin erosion in some areas. Channel shape thus remains subject to dynamic processes related to local variations in sediment supply, albeit to a more limited extent than in earlier decades.},

Providing a smooth transition between sharp crested and finite crested weir equations, a generalized rectangular weir equation has been evolved. This equation is applicable to all head-to-height ratios and all head-to-width ratios or sharp crested and finite crested weirs.

This trained channel was previously the main bed of the upper Rhine downstream of Basel (Switzerland), but it has an artificially low flow regime since the construction of the Grand Canal d'Alsace, a navigation canal, and a flow control dam at Kembs (France). Training works and subsequent channel incision have also greatly reduced sediment transport rates and created a heavily armoured bed. The modelled pilot site has a groyne field on the left bank. Results show that the currently existing groynes at the site are not effective in creating high bank-side velocities conducive to bank erosion, even for flow rates significantly higher than the mean annual flow rate. The river bank has also proved to be more resistant than previously thought, allowing long stretches of bank protection to be safely removed. The physical model testing process has produced a new configuration for the groyne field, where two higher, larger island groynes are placed further apart than the three existing attached groynes. This innovative approach has proved effective, causing bank erosion for flow rates below the mean annual flow rate, with consistent erosion being observed. It has also been found that such a configuration does not pose a hazard for the Grand Canal d'Alsace, which is situated next to the Old Rhine, through excessive bank erosion during high flow events.},

  abstract = {Abstract The artificial gravel augmentation of river channels is increasingly being used to mitigate the adverse effects of river regulation and sediment starvation. A systematic framework for designing and assessing such gravel augmentations is still lacking, notably on large rivers. Monitoring is required to quantify the movement of augmented gravel, measure bedform changes, assess potential habitat enhancement, and reduce the uncertainty in sediment management. Here we present the results of an experiment conducted in the Rhine River (French and German border). In 2010, 23 000 m3 of sediments (approximately the mean annual bedload transport capacity) were supplied in a by-passed reach downstream of the Kembs dam to test the feasibility of enhancing sediment transport and bedform changes. A 620-m-long and 12-m-wide gravel deposit was created 8 km downstream from the dam. Monitoring included topo-bathymetric surveys, radio-frequency particle tracking using passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags, bed grain size measurement, and airborne imagery. Six surveys performed since 2009 have been described (before and after gravel augmentation, and after Q2 and Q15 floods). The key findings are that (i) the augmented gravel was partially dispersed by the first flood event of December 2010 (Q1); (ii) PIT tags were found up to 3200 m downstream of the gravel augmentation site after four years, but the effects of gravel augmentation could not be clearly distinguished from the effects of floods and internal remobilization on more than 3500 m downstream; (iii) linear and log-linear relationships linking bedload transport, particle mobility, and grain size were established; and (iv) combined bathymetry and PIT tag surveys were useful for evaluating potential environmental risks and the first morpho-ecological responses. This confirmed the complementary nature of such techniques in the monitoring of gravel augmentation in large rivers. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract     = {The Old Rhine downstream of the Kembs diversion dam is one of the largest by-passed river reaches in the world (50km). It offers a unique opportunity to study the morphological effects of by-passing and address physical and ecological restoration approaches in regulated rivers. We conduct a space-time analysis of channel adjustment over a period of 80years (1932 to 2011). We examine planform changes (from aerial photographs), erosional and depositional patterns (from vertical profiles), sediment sizes within the active channel and the new established floodplain, and we date riparian vegetation encroachment. Results show that the Old Rhine exhibited rapid response to the completion of the by-passing scheme in the 1950s, with a 26% narrowing in median active channel width between 1956 and 2008, from vegetation encroachment on dewatered channel margins (mostly groyne fields). The narrowing was accompanied by overbank fine sediment deposition (~1.5cmy−1 aggradation since 1950) as well as slight bed degradation (~0.7cmy−1 since 1950). We found no downstream propagation of active channel narrowing over time, nor propagation of bed degradation. The channel was already significantly adjusted prior to the diversion scheme, following the nineteenth century river straightening and groyne construction. By-passing (dewatering) mainly provided new pioneer habitat for synchronous vegetation establishment and promoted channel stability by decreasing sediment transport owing to peak flow reduction. The morphological budget calculated over the past 20years estimated a downstream output for coarse sediments at 16,000m3y−1, with 80% originating from bed degradation and 20% from bank erosion, without significant inputs from upstream. The present-day morphodynamics remain sensitive to changes because of dynamic bed armouring (<2.1). This retrospective analysis permits us to discuss management strategies for altered rivers. Recommended activities are gravel reintroduction with particle-sizes finer than the armoured river bed to enhance sediment transport and promote form dynamism under current flood magnitudes. This should be coupled with river widening to allow for complex depositional patterns that benefit ecological habitats. These actions should not be implemented without prior analysis of local sediment transfer processes based on in situ experiments and modelling.},

However, as has frequently been mentioned in the scientific literature, quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the project benefits, if any, and their sustainability are hindered by the difficulty in assessing the responses of aquatic and riparian communities to the methods employed. A case study was conducted on a by-passed section of the Upper Rhine River (France and Germany) to investigate the effects of instream flow increase and gravel augmentation on selected aquatic and riparian communities (macroinvertebrates, macrophytes, and riparian plants). This paper presents the results of a 6-year interdisciplinary, before-after control-impact design monitoring study. The complexity of the study lies in carrying out a separate assessment of the cumulative effects on a site-based, project-specific basis. The results showed that (a) the instream flow increase resulted in greater richness of macrophyte species in the newly created backwaters, (b) the artificial gravel bar favoured the recruitment of pioneer species, including invasive species, although gravel redistribution by floods prevented their development, and (c) gravel augmentation tended to promote the taxonomic richness of macroinvertebrate communities with the appearance of species adapted to the new substrate areas. These findings should help to fill the knowledge gaps in large-scale restoration and contribute key responses to the most frequently arising issues in this area, especially those concerning the efficiency and sustainability of river restoration projects.},

  abstract = {The world’s big rivers and their floodplains were central to development of civilization and are now home to c. 2.7 billion people. They are economically vital whilst also constituting some of the most diverse habitats on Earth. However, a number of anthropogenic stressors, including large-scale damming, hydrological change, pollution, introduction of non-native species and sediment mining, challenge their integrity and future, as never before. The rapidity and extent of such change is so great that large-scale, and potentially irreparable, transformations may ensue in periods of years to decades, with ecosystem collapse being possible in some big rivers. Prioritizing the fate of the world’s great river corridors on an international political stage is imperative. Future sustainable management, and establishment of environmental flow requirements for the world’s big rivers, must be supported through co-ordinated international funding, and trans-continental political agreement to monitor these rivers, finance their continual upkeep and help ameliorate increasing anthropogenic pressures. To have any effect, all of these must be set within an inclusive governance framework across scales, organizations and local populace.},

  abstract     = {Massive bed degradation (20 m in 7 years) has been observed in the Shi‑ting River, Sichuan Province, China, since the 2008 Wenchuan Ms. 8.0 earthquake. The reason for the massive bed degradation has not been well understood. A hypothesis has been proposed that relates bed degradation to the augmentation of sand supply after the earthquake. The effect of sand on gravel mobility (magic sand effect) has long been observed in laboratory experiments. In this paper, we study whether the augmentation of sand supply and its magic sand effect can lead to the observed massive degradation at decadal scales. A one-dimensional river morphodynamic model is implemented to study the problem in general at field scale and in context of the gravel-bed Shi‑ting River. Sediment transport is calculated with the Wilcock and Crowe (2003) relation, in which the magic sand effect is explicitly embedded in terms of a function relating reference Shields number to the surface sand fraction. We find that the augmentation of gravel supply leads to bed aggradation, whereas the augmentation of sand supply can indeed lead to bed degradation and surface fining. The magnitude and timescale of bed degradation are not sensitive to the sand supply rate but are sensitive to the flood intermittency factor, i.e., the fraction of time the river is in flood. However, an unrealistic flood intermittency factor (≥0.3) would be required in order to match the observed timescale of bed degradation, thus indicating that the magic sand effect might not be the governing reason for massive bed degradation in the Shi‑ting River, and by implication in gravel-bed rivers in general. Our simulation results also indicate that despite the fact that magic sand effects are not explicitly included in most sediment transport relations, they are at least partly built in via the hiding function that is contained in most sediment transport relations for gravel-sand mixtures. While here we use the Shi‑ting River as an example, our results have applicability to gravel-bed rivers subjected to augmentation in sand supply in general.},

Seven kinds of pile-group arrangements were tested, including the side-by-side arrangements of piles, tandem arrangements of piles, and triangular and square group arrangements with two-, three-, and four-pile groups. The variations with the pile spacing as well as the Keulegan-Carpenter number, KC, were investigated. The scour depth can increase with respect to its single-pile value by as much as a factor of 3 for moderate KC numbers [such as O(10)] for most of the pile-group configurations for small pile spacings. For small KC numbers, this increase can be even higher, by as much as a factor of 10 or more. For a given pile spacing, the scour depth is mainly governed by the KC number. In agreement with the single-pile case, the larger the KC number, the larger the scour depth. The bed was live in all the tests except a few cases.},

We investigate the response of the Lower Rhine River (Germany-Netherlands) to engineering measures, in terms of channel slope and bed surface grain size. Field data show domain-wide incision, primarily associated with extensive channel narrowing. Remarkably, the channel slope has increased in the upstream end, which is uncommon under degradational conditions. We attribute the observed response to two competing mechanisms: bedrock at the upstream boundary increases the channel slope over the upstream part of the alluvial reach to compensate for the reduction of net annual sediment mobility, and extensive channel narrowing reduces the equilibrium slope. Another striking feature is the advance and flattening of the gravel-sand transition, suggesting its gradual fading due to an increasingly reduced slope difference between the gravel and sand reaches.},

The model solves simplified equations of mass and momentum, which are driven by storm surge and wave boundary conditions, precipitation rates and upstream river discharges. It includes spatially-varying infiltration and bed roughness terms as well as an absorbing-generating seaward boundary to enable wave-driven flooding. Furthermore, advection and wind stress terms can be included. We demonstrate for the application case of hurricane impact on Jacksonville (Florida, USA) that the observed flooding was a combination of fluvial, pluvial, tidal and wind-driven flooding and that this can be modeled well using the reduced-physics solver. We show that the addition of an advection term to the momentum equations is necessary to model shock flows such as dam breaks but also incident broken waves. Thus, wave-driven flooding can be modeled with high computational efficiency and adequate accuracy as demonstrated for the case of Hernani (the Philippines). The model results show the potential of achieving good accuracy at limited computational expense.},

  abstract = {Summary This paper describes the development of a new set of equations derived from 1D shallow water theory for use in 2D storage cell inundation models where flows in the x and y Cartesian directions are decoupled. The new equation set is designed to be solved explicitly at very low computational cost, and is here tested against a suite of four test cases of increasing complexity. In each case the predicted water depths compare favourably to analytical solutions or to simulation results from the diffusive storage cell code of Hunter et al. (2005). For the most complex test involving the fine spatial resolution simulation of flow in a topographically complex urban area the Root Mean Squared Difference between the new formulation and the model of Hunter et al. is ∼1cm. However, unlike diffusive storage cell codes where the stable time step scales with (1/Δx)2, the new equation set developed here represents shallow water wave propagation and so the stability is controlled by the Courant–Freidrichs–Lewy condition such that the stable time step instead scales with 1/Δx. This allows use of a stable time step that is 1–3 orders of magnitude greater for typical cell sizes than that possible with diffusive storage cell models and results in commensurate reductions in model run times. For the tests reported in this paper the maximum speed up achieved over a diffusive storage cell model was 1120×, although the actual value seen will depend on model resolution and water surface gradient. Solutions using the new equation set are shown to be grid-independent for the conditions considered and to have an intuitively correct sensitivity to friction, however small instabilities and increased errors on predicted depth were noted when Manning’s n=0.01. The new equations are likely to find widespread application in many types of flood inundation modelling and should provide a useful additional tool, alongside more established model formulations, for a variety of flood risk management studies.},

	abstract = {Tropical cyclones (TCs) have tremendous impact on coastal communities in terms of damage due to flooding and high wind velocities, as shown by the recent hurricane season of 2017. Coastal flooding due to TCs can be contributed to different types of forcing (e.g. high offshore water levels, rainfall, etc.), or multiple at the same time (i.e. compound flooding). While the impact of TCs increases, there is the need for better predictions and early warning systems (EWSs). Probabilistic forecasting by modelling different ensembles is wanted to account for uncertainties, which requires fast models. Current modelling options are static models (bathtub approach), which are fast but too simple. Furthermore there are advanced process-based models (like Delft3D, XBeach) which are accurate but too computationally expensive. The solution is the use of a semi-advanced model which solves all relevant processes, but does that in a computationally efficient way. The semi-advanced SFINCS model is developed to solve all necessary processes with computationally efficiency in mind, but is still in its development phase. This research assesses how compound flooding due to TCs can be modelled in an accurate and computationally efficient way. Besides assessing the relevant physical processes, the implementation in a semi-advanced model is tested. In multiple tests it is shown that for conceptual situations a semi-advanced model can give accurate results within certain limits. Also it is shown in what conditions the advection term of the momentum balance needs to be solved and that a swash zone model approach with an indirect random forcing can give realistic results in 1D runup tests. A case study of the compound flooding at Jacksonville, Florida, during Hurricane Irma (2017) shows that using a semi-advanced model, a similar accuracy compared to Delft3D can be achieved while being two orders of magnitude faster. Furthermore, a first test with wave-driven flooding in a real case study at Hernani, the Philippines, during Typhoon Haiyan (2013) shows that wave-driven processes have to be explicitly included to model all types of compound flooding. The approach to include these processes with the semi-advanced SFINCS model gives reasonable results compared to XBeach, although they can be further improved with more research. The resulting computational efficiency seems to get in the right range as needed for EWSs.},

However, there is a scarcity of sediment transport predictors that directly account for the effects of plants, and existing methods, based on re-calculation of roughness coefficients, may present some inconsistencies. The approach herein proposed extends Einstein's parameters to include the effects of vegetation on sediment transport for implementation in existing bedload predictors of the form $\Psi = f(\Phi)$. The new formulations are applicable in presence of submerged and emergent vegetation and reduce to the original Einstein's parameters if vegetation is absent. Calibration is based on laboratory data. For this purpose, an extensive experimental program was carried out on a tilting glass-walled flume with medium-sand bed and plants represented by aluminum cylinders. Validation is based on published bedload measurements from the literature. The results show a much better agreement between measurements and predictions when applying the extended parameters compared to using Einstein's original ones. Predicted bedload rates have, on average, the same order of magnitude of the measured ones, and quantitative agreement is substantially increased. Clear improvements were also observed when comparing the results with the bedload predictions of Baptist's (2005) method, which is based on the re-calculation of bed roughness in the presence of vegetation.},

  abstract = {The bedload transport system of equations, composed by the two-dimensional shallow water equations for the free surface flow motion and the 2D Exner or bedload transport equation for the erodible bed layer, is used for a wide range of sediment transport processes in environmental surface flows. In this work, the numerical resolution has been implemented using improved and efficient versions of two different strategies for combining the hydrodynamical and morphodynamical components of the system. The first strategy is based on the full coupling of the flow and bedload transport equations (FCM), leading to a new formulation for the intercell numerical fluxes which includes the bed elevation into the resolution of the approximated local Riemann problem (RP) at the edges. The stability region of this method is controlled by the eigenvalues of the coupled Jacobian matrix at each intercell edge. On the second hand, an alternative decoupled strategy is considered based on solving independently the shallow water and the bed transport equations at each time step but controlling the stability region by means of an approximation of the coupled Jacobian matrix eigenvalues. This method, called approximate-coupled (ACM) allows simpler expressions for the numerical fluxes at the edges and ensures the stability of the scheme. Both strategies are based on the Finite Volume (FV) method using Roe’s approach for the computation of the numerical fluxes between neighbouring cells and have been implemented into the same CPU-based numerical kernel in order to perform a realistic comparison of the range of applicability and computational efficiency. The ACM can only guarantee non-oscillatory results when the bed-flow interaction factor is small G<O(10−3). If the interaction factor G is medium or high, G>O(10−2), the decoupled scheme loses its accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, for highly erosive flows the FCM scheme demonstrates to be more efficient in terms of computational effort than the ACM, one of the key points for large-scale and long-term bedload transport realistic applications.},

The basins of the Tumbes, Chira, Piura, Lambayeque, Zana, Reque, Jequetepeque, Chicama, Moche, and Viru rivers in Peru were the most affected areas. In the ocean reduced fish stocks caused starvation among seabirds and mammals. The altiplano highlands suffered severe drought. There is a coincidence between past El Nino occurrences and tropical volcanic activity. The eruption of El Chinchon in April 1982 appears to be closely related to El Nino 1982-83.]},

abstract = {Abstract Lateral flow separation occurs in rivers where banks exhibit strong curvature. In canyon-bound rivers, lateral recirculation zones are the principal storage of fine-sediment deposits. A parallelized, three-dimensional, turbulence-resolving model was developed to study the flow structures along lateral separation zones located in two pools along the Colorado River in Marble Canyon. The model employs the detached eddy simulation (DES) technique, which resolves turbulence structures larger than the grid spacing in the interior of the flow. The DES-3D model is validated using Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler flow measurements taken during the 2008 controlled flood release from Glen Canyon Dam. A point-to-point validation using a number of skill metrics, often employed in hydrological research, is proposed here for fluvial modeling. The validation results show predictive capabilities of the DES model. The model reproduces the pattern and magnitude of the velocity in the lateral recirculation zone, including the size and position of the primary and secondary eddy cells, and return current. The lateral recirculation zone is open, having continuous import of fluid upstream of the point of reattachment and export by the recirculation return current downstream of the point of separation. Differences in magnitude and direction of near-bed and near-surface velocity vectors are found, resulting in an inward vertical spiral. Interaction between the recirculation return current and the main flow is dynamic, with large temporal changes in flow direction and magnitude. Turbulence structures with a predominately vertical axis of vorticity are observed in the shear layer becoming three-dimensional without preferred orientation downstream.},

 abstract = {Debris fans debouching into the bottom of Grand Canyon create rapids and flow separation in the Colorado River. The patterns of flow and the behavior of recirculation zones formed by flow separation are consistent throughout the Canyon's length. Zones of recirculating flow occur along the margin of channel expansions. Recirculation zones are comprised of one primary eddy; secondary eddies and areas of unorganized low velocity may exist upstream from the primary eddy. The longest recirculation zones are formed by channel constrictions of low width-to-depth ratio. Recirculation zones increase in length with increasing discharge. Sand bars form beneath recirculation zones, especially near separation and reattachment points. Reattachment bars project upstream from the reattachment point and underlie primary eddies. Separation bars mantle the downstream parts of the debris fans and form beneath secondary eddies and low-velocity areas. Sediment that forms reattachment bars is dominated by sizes characteristic of suspended load, while sediment that forms separation bars is finer. Reattachment bars are more common than separation bars, and both occur more frequently and are larger in wide reaches. The form and location of these bars is consistent with the location and behavior of stagnation points; however, the locations of these stagnation points change. Although velocity increases in the main channel at high discharges, velocities near the separation and reattachment points remain low. Sedimentation can occur in a bedrock gorge at high discharges and low transport rates, although the location of high-discharge sand bars may differ from those deposited at lower flows.},

  abstract = {In the Rhine-Meuse delta in the south-western part of the Netherlands, the morphology of the river branches is highly dependent on the erodibility of the subsoil. Erosion processes that were initiated after closure of the Haringvliet estuary branch by a dam (in 1970), caused a strong incision of several connecting branches. Due to the geological evolution of this area the lithology of the subsoil shows large variations in highly erodible sand and poorly erodible peat and clay layers. This study shows how the geological information can be used to create 3D maps of the erodibility of the sub-soil, and how this information can be used to schematize the sub-soil in computational models for morphological simulations. Local incisement of sand patches between areas with poorly erodible bed causes deep scour holes, hence increasing the risk on river-bank instability (flow slides) and damage to constructions such as groynes, quays, tunnels, and pipelines. Various types of mathematical models, ranging from 1D (SOBEK) to quasi-3D (Delft3D) have been applied to study the future development of the river bed and possible management options. The results of these approaches demonstrate that models require inclusion of a layer-bookkeeping approach for sub-soil schematization, non-uniform sediment fractions (sand-mud), tidal and river-discharge boundary conditions, and capacity-reduction transport modeling. For risk-reducing river management it has been shown how the development of the river bed can be addressed on a large scale and small scale. For instance, the use of sediment feeding and fixation of bed can be proposed for large-scale management, while monitoring and interventions at initiation of erosion can be proposed as response to small-scale developments that exceed predefined intervention levels.},

  abstract  = {Hydrodynamic models play a key role in simulating total water level (TWL), that is, a combination of river flow, tide, surge, wind and wave-induced water level, and representing flood inundation dynamics in coastal areas. An appropriate selection of two-dimensional (2D) models that integrate riverine and estuarine interactions with ocean dynamics is crucial to generate accurate TWL predictions and assist stakeholders and federal agencies in decision making and flood emergency responses. In this study, we compare the performance of two widely used hydrodynamic models (e.g., 2D HEC-RAS and Delft3D-Flexible Mesh [FM]) with respect to their ability of predicting TWL in Delaware Bay, United States. Based on a previously established model configuration, we simulate Hurricane Sandy and Isabel that affected the Bay and led to considerable damages and economic losses. We then evaluate model capabilities with tidal analysis, compare observed vs. simulated TWL and analyze spatiotemporal variations of TWL through scenario-based simulations. Our results suggest that atmospheric forcing input in Delft3D-FM significantly improves TWL predictions as compared to those of 2D HEC-RAS. Furthermore, model simulations with Delft3D-FM can be faster than 2D HEC-RAS by a factor of 6–10. Despite these advantages, 2D HEC-RAS (version 5.07) is a noncommercial software easier to implement and can be a simpler alternative for modeling extreme events when atmospheric forcing is not relevant in the model domain.},

  abstract = {A computational scheme has been developed and tested to simulate property exchange by advection and dispersion in estuaries at time and space scales that are well suited to ecological and management simulations, but are coarse relative to the demands of physical hydrodynamic models. An implementation of the Regional Ocean Model System (ROMS) for the Providence River and Narragansett Bay (RI, USA) was used to determine property exchanges between the spatial elements of an ecological box model. The basis for the method is the statistical tabulation of numerical dye experiments done with the full ROMS physical model. The ROMS model domain was subdivided into fifteen coarse boxes, each with two vertical layers, defining 30 elements that were used for the box model simulations. Dye concentrations were set to arbitrary initial concentrations for all ROMS grids in the large elements, and the ROMS model was run for 24h. The final distribution of the dye among the elements was used as a tracer for property exchange over that day and was used to develop an exchange matrix. Box model predictions of salinity over 77 days in each element compared favorably with ROMS simulated salinity averaged over the same spatial elements, although the disparity was greater in areas where large river inflows caused strong gradients in ROMS within elements assumed to be homogeneous in the box model. The 77-day simulation included periods of high and low river flow. Despite the large size of the spatial elements, dispersion artifacts were small, much less than the modeled daily exchanges. While others have taken a similar approach, we found a number of theoretical and practical considerations deserved careful attention for this approach to perform satisfactorily. Whereas the full ROMS model takes 9 days on a powerful computing cluster to compute the physics simulation for 77 days, the box model simulates physics and biology for the same interval in 5s on a personal computer, and a full year in under 1min. The exchange matrix mixing model is a fast, cost effective, and convenient way to simulate daily variation of complex estuarine physics in ecological modeling at appropriate scales of space and time.},

  abstract = {Abstract QuadriFlow is a scalable algorithm for generating quadrilateral surface meshes based on the Instant Field-Aligned Meshes of Jakob et al. (ACM Trans. Graph. 34(6):189, 2015). We modify the original algorithm such that it efficiently produces meshes with many fewer singularities. Singularities in quadrilateral meshes cause problems for many applications, including parametrization and rendering with Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces. Singularities can rarely be entirely eliminated, but it is possible to keep their number small. Local optimization algorithms usually produce meshes with many singularities, whereas the best algorithms tend to require non-local optimization, and therefore are slow. We propose an efficient method to minimize singularities by combining the Instant Meshes objective with a system of linear and quadratic constraints. These constraints are enforced by solving a global minimum-cost network flow problem and local boolean satisfiability problems. We have verified the robustness and efficiency of our method on a subset of ShapeNet comprising 17,791 3D objects in the wild. Our evaluation shows that the quality of the quadrangulations generated by our method is as good as, if not better than, those from other methods, achieving about four times fewer singularities than Instant Meshes. Other algorithms that produce similarly few singularities are much slower; we take less than ten seconds to process each model. Our source code is publicly available.},

The first scour appears in the wake of the cylinder. The main scouring agent in the upstream region is a system of horseshoe vortices. The vortices have a periodical character that causes a triple‐scour profile to develop in the upstream region. During scouring, the number and periods of horseshoe vortex shedding undergo no appreciable change. Despite the clear water stage, the transport phenomenon is periodical. Transport of sediment takes place through turbulent scales of comparable size to macro‐length scales. The size of the horseshoe vortices are representative for the macroscale. Wake scouring is caused by the primary wake vortices and the accelerated side flow. The process is characterized by a strong periodical transport and the formation of ripples. The periodicity is controlled by the shedding frequency of the wake vortices. Collars attached to the cylinder cannot prevent the formation of the vortices.},

title  =  {"Games to Collaboratively Explore Environmental Complexity: Designing the Virtual River Game"}, 
abstract  =  {"Serious games are increasingly developed and applied in environmental management as tools to collaboratively explore complexity. Yet, the research, design and implementation of serious games is still largely driven by technical aspects as a result of advances in computational power and in the gaming industry. Less attention has been given to research the extent to which the design of serious games can cater to the needs and desires of stakeholders with diverse backgrounds. The aim of this thesis is therefore to explore how a human centered design of serious games contributes to foster exploring complexity, facilitating stakeholder participation and stimulating social learning in environmental management. In this thesis, the design, application and evaluation of the Virtual River Game is described. First, the scope and background of the game was researched by conducting interviews with various stakeholders to gain an understanding of Dutch river management challenges and stakeholder perspectives on these. Second, the state-of-the-art in evaluating social learning outcomes of serious games to collaboratively explore complexity was analyzed and used as both design guidelines and an assessment framework for the game. Third, a novel, hybrid interface design was developed that, based on tangible interaction, has a physical game board with a bidirectional link to computer models that are widely used in practice. Fourth, the final prototype of the Virtual River Game was played in five sessions with both domain experts (river management professionals) and non-experts (non-professionals and laymen) to evaluate to what extent the game: (1) enables these stakeholders with diverse backgrounds to collaboratively explore river management complexity; and (2) stimulates social learning.The four main contributions of this thesis are: (1) applying a human centered design process to the design of serious games; (2) developing a novel interface design that uses a physical game board linked to environmental computer models to make the models accessible and transparent; (3) adding the ability to experiment with the design of management interventions as a game mechanic over selecting predefined interventions; and (4) creating the interface design as a platform to customize existing or develop new serious games with a spatial component."},

The experiments were devoted mainly to an examination of the behaviour of models of the same hypothetical estuary, of symmetrical shape, to different scales. As a result of this investigation, the committee reported in 1891 to the effect that “It would seem therefore that by carefully observing certain [stated] precautions, the method of model investigation may now be applied with confidence to practical problems”.},

  abstract     = {The flow in every meandering channel with a specific sinuosity has its own convective pattern. However, most of the previous numerical works did not take this nature as an essential aspect when validating their computed flows, and even some typical works turned out to fail to capture the correct convective patterns of meandering flows. In this paper, a numerical model is established on the basis of the three-dimensional continuity and Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and used to simulate two representative laboratory tests where the channels had different sinuosities and the flows manifested different convective patterns. The agreement between the computed and measured flow characteristics for both tests demonstrates that the present model can capture the correct convective patterns of meandering flows for various sinuosities. The reasons are inferred as the use of the k-ε turbulence model to determine the eddy viscosity throughout almost the whole flow depth and the use of the antisymmetrically identical condition at the inlet and outlet boundaries of a meander loop.},

  abstract = {In this study, the effect of the collar plate usage on local scour around a pile due to propeller jet flow was investigated experimentally. Experiments were carried out for unconfined conditions, only existence of a pile and a pile with collar plate. Three different collar plate widths (W) and two different locations of the collar plate with respect to the seabed (hc) were used to determine the effect of the collar plate on scour. Three different rotational speeds were used and scour around a pile was measured by using an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter Profiler (ADVP). Since the experiments were completed before reaching the equilibrium state, present study can be considered as a short-term study. The results of the experimental studies show that the amount of reduction of scour around a pile is sensitive to the collar plate width and location of the collar plate. A collar plate application is an effective way for reducing scour around a pile. The most effective type of collar plate was determined as a condition in which W/D and hc/y0 are equal to 3 and 0, respectively. The amount of reduction in scour around a pile was observed as 75%.},

Engineering methods used in dealing with pier‐scour problems include placing coarse riprap around the foundations. An inverted filter layer is normally placed beneath the riprap to overcome leaching problems. Practical difficulties in laying the filter according to specifications, especially in deep water, often cause failure of the riprap layer. The study examines the effect of using a slot in the pier, or a collar around it, as devices for controlling the depth of scour. Experiments conducted in clear‐water conditions show that the use of a slot alone (with a width equal to one‐fourth of the pier diameter) can reduce equilibrium scour depth by as much as 20\%. A combination of slot and collar can further reduce the scour depth. These devices may be useful as additional or alternative devices for scour protection.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a hydraulic and morphological analysis of the Lower Jamuna in Bangladesh with a focus on two key bifurcations that are important for stabilization of the Lower Jamuna reach. We used ground measurements, historical data, multispectral satellite images from various sources as well as numerical models. We carried out hydraulic analyses of the changes and their peculiarities, such as flow distributions at the bifurcation and hysteresis of the stageâ€“discharge relationships. We supplemented our analysis by using numerical models to simulate discharge distribution at the bifurcations under various flow and riverbed conditions. We developed an advanced and automated satellite image processing application for the Lower Jamuna, referred to as Morphology Monitor (MoMo), using the Google Earth Engine. MoMo was found to be an effective tool for a rapid assessment and analysis of the changes in deep-channel and sandbar areas. It is also useful for monitoring and assessing riverbank and char erosion and accretion, which is important not only for morphological but also ecological impact assessment. The application can be adapted as an operational tool as well. Furthermore, we assessed the evolution of deep channels at the bifurcations based on regularly and extensively measured bathymetry data. The analysis was carried out in complement with morphological modeling, particularly for short-term prediction. In this paper we present the major findings of the analysis and discuss their implications for adaptive river management.},

The drag forces were measured by means of strain gages. The results indicate that the drag is strongly affected by mutual interaction with neighboring cylinders over a range of separation distances and angles of orientation with respect to the free-stream flow. The interaction decreases with increasing orientation angle, becoming very weak at θ = 90 deg when the cylinders are separated by at least two diameters. For spacings of approximately four diameters, the drag coefficients for the three-cylinder geometry reach a value which will remain almost constant for larger spacings. This is true for all three cylinders and for all orientations. The orientation of the cylinders influences only slightly the drag on the upstream cylinder for groups of both two and three cylinders. For downstream cylinders, the drag coefficient decreases with increasing Reynolds number due to the increased amount of unsteadiness contained in the flow behind the upstream cylinder.}},

  abstract = {Mangrove vegetation provides natural protection against coastal hazards like flooding and erosion. In spite of their economic and societal value, mangrove forests have experienced a worldwide decline due to human activities. Bamboo structures, formed by poles driven into the soil, are being used to create a sheltered environment for mangrove restoration. The lack of design rules for the structures has led to mixed success rates in their implementation. Improving future designs requires a better understanding of how the bamboo poles affect waves and currents. Currents cause drag forces on the poles, which depend on flow acceleration through the elements (blockage), and the distance from wakes of upstream cylinders (sheltering). We developed a model that predicts the bulk drag coefficient of dense arrays of emergent cylinders in a current, including blockage, sheltering and a balance between turbulence production and dissipation. The model could reproduce measured bulk drag coefficients from the literature within a deviation of 20%. The model also showed that anisotropic structures with small spanwise spacing and large streamwise separation maximize the bulk drag coefficient, and the energy dissipation per pole. The application of the model can guide the design of future mangrove restoration efforts.},

  ABSTRACT = {In forested mountain catchment areas, both bedload and large wood (LW) can be transported during ordinary flows. Retention structures such as sediment traps or racks are built to mitigate potential hazards downstream. Up to now, the design of these retention structures focuses on either LW or bedload. In addition, the majority of LW retention racks tend to retain both LW and bedload, while bedload transport continuity during ordinary flows is an important aspect to be considered in the design. Therefore, a series of flume experiments was conducted to study the effect of LW accumulations at an inclined bar screen with a bottom clearance on backwater rise and bedload transport. The main focus was put on testing different LW characteristics such as LW size, density, fine material, and shape (branches and rootwads), as well as a sequenced flood. The results demonstrated that a few logs (wood volume of ≈ 7 m3 prototype scale with a model scale factor of 30) are sufficient to reduce the bedload transport capacity to below 75% compared to the condition without LW. Fine material and smaller wood sizes further reduced bedload transport and increased backwater rise. In contrast, LW density and LW shape had a negligible effect. The test focusing on a sequenced flood highlighted the need for maintenance measures to avoid self-flushing of the bed material. The results of this study further indicate that an inclined bar screen may need to be adapted by considering LW characteristics in the design of the bottom clearance to enable bedload continuity during ordinary flows.},

  abstract = {The Dead Sea is a hypersaline terminal lake experiencing a water level drop of about 1 m/yr over the last decade. The existing estimations for the water balance of the lake are widely variable, reflecting the unknown subsurface water inflow, the rate of evaporation, and the rate of salt accumulation at the lake bottom. To estimate these we calculate the energy and mass balances for the Dead Sea utilizing measured meteorological and hydrographical data from 1996 to 2001, taking into account the impact of lowered surface water activity on the evaporation rate. Salt precipitation during this period was about 0.1 m/yr. The average annual inflow is 265–325 × 106 m3/yr, corresponding to an evaporation rate of 1.1–1.2 m/yr. Higher inflows, suggested in previous studies, call for increased evaporation rate and are therefore not in line with the energy balance.},

  abstract = {Morphodynamic modeling systems are being subjected to a growing development over the last decade and increasingly appear as valuable tools for understanding and predicting coastal dynamics and morphological changes. The recent improvements of a 2DH unstructured grid morphodynamic modeling system are presented in this paper and include the implementation of an adaptive morphodynamic time step, the integration and full coupling of a wave model and the forcing by large scale wave and tide models. This modeling system was first applied to a dissipative wave-dominated beach located on the French coast, where the availability of field data allowed for a fine calibration and validation of wave-induced flows and longshore transport, and an assessment of the various sediment transport formulae. The modeling system was then applied to a very dynamic Portuguese tidal inlet where numerical tests show the computational efficiency of using an adaptive time step. Morphodynamic simulations of this inlet with real wave and tidal forcings resulted in realistic morphological predictions. The two applications show that the improved modeling system is able to predict hydrodynamics, transport and morphological evolutions in complex coastal environments.},

  abstract     = {Binnen het kader van een vergunningsaanvraag voor het storten van baggerspecie in de diepe putten van de Westerschelde heeft de Vlaams Nederlandse Schelde Commissie (VNSC) Deltares gevraagd de sedimentdynamica in de putten te onderzoeken. Deze studie richt zich daarbij op de 3D stroompatronen in twee diepe putten nabij Borssele en Hansweert middels een data-analyse en modelsimulaties. Zowel metingen als 3D modellering tonen het bestaan van gravitatiecirculatie processen in de hoofd- en secundaire stroomrichting. De secundaire stroming staat haaks op de hoofdrichting en toont absolute snelheden met een orde grootte van 10% van de stroming bij maximum eb en vloed. Meerdere circulatiecellen kunnen dwars op de diepe putten ontstaan. Sommigen ervan veranderen van richting tussen eb en vloed, terwijl anderen hun richting behouden. Model simulaties tonen dat de secundaire stroming in de putten wordt veroorzaakt door relatief kleine zoutgradiënten. De waargenomen stroming kan dus niet enkel worden verklaard met de klassieke bochtstroming theorie. Uit een grove schaalanalyse van de verschillende termen in de laterale momentum vergelijking blijkt dat de circulatie patronen waarschijnlijk hoofdzakelijk worden gedreven door de baroclinische druk gradiënten, advectieve versnelling en door wrijving. Het waarnemen van zoutgradiënten in toekomstige meetcampagnes zou zeer waardevol zijn om het 3D model in termen van saliniteit te valideren. De secundaire stroming heeft waarschijnlijk geen grote impact op de omvang van het sedimenttransport, gezien de snelheden ervan (max.~0.3 m/s) beperkt zijn vergeleken met de stroomsnelheden in de hoofdrichting (max.~2 m/s). De secundaire stroming kan echter wel bijdragen aan het mengen van gesuspendeerd sediment in de waterkolom. Daarnaast kan de richting van het bodemtransport worden beïnvloed door de secundaire circulatie. Toekomstige studies zullen in detail ingaan op de invloed van de 3D dynamiek op het sedimenttransport.},

  abstract     = {Measuring bedload transport rates usually involves measuring the flux of sediment or collecting sediment during a certain interval of time Δt. Because bedload transport rates exhibit significant non-Gaussian fluctuations, their time-averaged rates depend a great deal on Δt. We begin by exploring this issue theoretically within the framework of Markov processes. We define the bedload transport rate either as the particle flux through a control surface or as a quantity related to the number of moving particles and their velocities in a control volume. These quantities are double averaged; that is, we calculate their ensemble and time averages. Both definitions lead to the same expression for the double-averaged mean rate and to the same scaling for the variance's dependence on the length of the sampling duration Δt. These findings lead us to propose a protocol for measuring double-averaged transport rates. We apply this protocol to an experiment we ran in a narrow flume using steady-state conditions (constant water discharge and sediment feed rates), in which the time variations in the particle flux, the number of moving particles, and their velocities were measured using high-speed cameras. The data agree well with the previously defined theoretical relationships. Lastly, we apply our experimental protocol to other flow conditions (a long laboratory flume and a gravel-bed river) to show its potential across various contexts.},

  abstract = {Over the last decade, modelling systems based on unstructured grids have been appearing increasingly attractive to investigate the dynamics of coastal zones. However, the resolution of the sediment continuity equation to simulate bed evolution is a complex problem which often leads to the development of numerical oscillations. To overcome this problem, addition of artificial diffusion or bathymetric filters are commonly employed methods, although these techniques can potentially over-smooth the bathymetry. This study aims to present a numerical scheme based on the Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) formalism to solve the bed continuity equation on unstructured grids in a finite volume formulation. The new solution is compared against a classical method, which combines a basic node-centered finite volume method with artificial diffusion, for three idealized test cases. This comparison reveals that a higher accuracy is obtained with our new method while the addition of diffusion appears inappropriate mainly due to the arbitrary choice of the diffusion coefficient. Moreover, the increased computation time associated with the WENO-based method to solve the bed continuity equation is negligible when considering a fully-coupled simulation with tides and waves. Finally, the application of the new method to the pluri-monthly evolution of an idealized inlet subjected to tides and waves shows the development of realistic bed features (e.g. secondary flood channels, ebb-delta sandbars, or oblique sandbars at the adjacent beaches), that are smoothed or nonexistent when using additional diffusion.},

Theoretical models based on two-dimensional shallow water and Exner equations have been successfully employed to capture the bar instability phenomenon, and to estimate bar properties such as height, wavelength and migration rate. However, the mathematical complexity of the problem hampered the understanding of the key physical mechanisms that sustain bar formation. To fill this gap, we considered a simplified version of the equations, based on neglecting the deformation of the free surface, which allows us to: (a) provide the first complete explanation of the bar formation mechanism as the result of a simple bond between variations of the water weight and flow acceleration; (b) derive a simplified, physically based formula for predicting bar formation in a river reach, depending on channel width-to-depth ratio, Shields number and relative submergence. Comparison with an unprecedented large set of laboratory experiments reveals that our simplified formula appropriately predicts alternate bar formation in a wide range of conditions. Noteworthy, the hypothesis of negligible free surface effect also implies that bar formation is fully independent of the Froude number. We show that this intriguing property is intimately related to the three-dimensional nature of river bars, which allows for a gentle lateral deviation of the flow without significant deformation of the water surface.},

We present the Virtual River Game that aims to support stakeholders in collaboratively exploring the complexity of a changed river management paradigm in the Netherlands. The game uses a novel, hybrid interface design that features a bidirectional coupling of a physical game board to computer models. We ran five game sessions involving both domain experts and non-experts to assess the game's value as a participatory tool. The results show that the game was effective in enabling participants to collaboratively experiment with various river interventions and in stimulating social learning. As a participatory tool, the game appears to be valuable to introduce non-expert stakeholders to Dutch river management. We further discuss how the hybrid interface combines qualities usually found in board and computer games that are beneficial in engaging stakeholders and stimulating learning.},

  abstract = {In het kader van de actualisering Sedimentbalans Noordelijk Deltabekken 1970-2000 is het van belang juiste informatie te hebben over de vracht aan slib die ons land via de Rijn en Maas binnenkomt. In principe is voor slib de vracht op eenvoudige wijze te berekenen door het debiet met de concentratie zwevend stof te vermenigvuldigen. Voor de Rijn is deze methode na 1989 toe te passen. Vanaf die periode wordt immers dagelijks het debiet gemeten en de concentratie zwevend stof, op basis van dagverzamelmonsters, bepaald. Voor 1989 werd de concentratie zwevend stof echter tweewekelijks middels steekmonsters gemeten. Op basis van vergelijking tussen steekmonsters en dagverzamelmonsters blijken significante verschillen in de waarden te bestaan waarbij de steekmonsters hogere concentraties laten zien. Dit betekent dat de jaarlijkse slibvracht van de Rijn voor 1989, berekend op basis van de steekmonsters, te hoog zal uitvallen. In deze studie wordt onderzocht of de jaarlijkse slibvracht in de Rijn in de periode voor 1989 niet op een andere wijze berekend kan worden. Op basis van statistische analyse blijkt een goede relatie te bestaan tussen de slibvracht en de afvoer. Hierbij wordt gecorrigeerd voor een waargenomen afname in de concentratie zwevend stof sinds 1960. De nauwkeurigheid van de berekende jaarvracht voor de Rijn ligt rond de 8% (gebaseerd op de berekende vracht en de werkelijk gemeten vracht tussen 1989 en 2000). Voor de Maas is eenzelfde relatie tussen debiet en slibvracht gevonden. Hierbij kon alleen van steekmonsters gebruik worden gemaakt. Derhalve kon geen nauwkeurigheid van de berekende vrachten voor de Maas worden bepaald.},

abstract = {Abstract Deltas and estuaries worldwide face the challenge of capturing sufficient sediment to keep up with relative sea-level rise. Knowledge about sediment pathways and fluxes is crucial to combat adverse effects on channel morphology, for example, erosion which enhances bank collapse and increasing tidal penetration. Here, we construct sediment budgets which quantify annual changes for the urbanized Rhine-Meuse Delta of the Netherlands, a typical urban delta experiences changing fluvial and coastal fluxes of sediment, engineering works and dredging and dumping activities. The delta shows a negative sediment budget (more outgoing than incoming sediment) since the 1980s, due to anthropogenic intervention. Following a large offshore port expansion, dredging in ports and harbors in the region has doubled in the past 5 years, likely due to the induced change in net sediment fluxes. In addition, the deeper navigation channels, ports, and harbors are now trapping siltier sediment, changing the sediment composition in the mouth. The removal of sediment by dredging is adverse to the necessity for sediment in heavily eroding branches. To allow for sustainable sediment management in the future and to cope with sea-level rise, further measurements are required to properly quantify the amount of incoming sediment at the boundaries of the system and the internal mechanisms of transport. The varied response of the branches has important consequences for navigation, ecology and flood safety and management of the sediment in the system. These effects will be of pivotal importance in coming decades with similar implications for many urbanized deltas worldwide.},

In order to ensure independence of the results from arbitrary turbulent velocity fluctuations in the initial fluid velocity field, 41 simulations of the test case starting from different initial flow fields were analysed. Results of these simulations are normally distributed. Mean values indicate three phases of the development of the sediment plume: (i) acceleration phase, (ii) transport phase and (iii) deposition phase.

  abstract = {Abstract Hydraulic roughness is a fundamental property in river research, as it directly affects water levels, flow strength and the associated sediment transport rates. However, quantification of roughness is challenging, as it is not directly measurable in the field. In lowland rivers, bedforms are a major source of hydraulic roughness. Decades of research have focused on dunes to allow parameterization of roughness, with relatively little focus on field verification. This study aims to establish the predictive capacity of current roughness predictors, and to identify reasons for the unexplained part of the variance in roughness. We quantified hydraulic roughness based on the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor (f) calculated from hydraulic field data of a 78 km-long trajectory of the river Rhine and river Waal in the Netherlands. This is compared to predicted roughness values based on dune geometry, and to the spatial trends in the local topographic leeside angle, both inferred from bathymetric field data. Results from both approaches show the same general trend and magnitude of roughness values (0.019 < f < 0.069). Roughness inferred from dune geometry explains at best 31\% of the variance. Efforts to explain the remaining variance from statistics of the local topographic leeside angles, which supposedly control flow separation, were unsuccessful. Unexpectedly, multi-kilometer depth oscillations explain 34\% of the total roughness variations. We suggest that flow divergence associated with depth increase causes energy loss, which is reflected in an elevated hydraulic roughness. Multi-kilometer depth variations occur in many rivers worldwide, which implies a cause of flow resistance that needs further study.},

Analysis of the gathered data showed that the presence of erosion in this section is positively related to sinuosity and negatively related to the presence of bank protection. Due to the presence of bank protection measures, erosion is still localised. Lateral erosion rates up to 2 meters per year have been found. Vertical aggradation rates of the pointbars do not show a clear correlation with sinuosity. Aggradation rates up to 0.15 meters per year have been found. The depth profiles of most of the pointbars show several superimposed fining-up sequences. In one of the pointbar- transects, younger sequences were found to be thicker than older sequences, possibly due to changes in sediment supply.

  abstract = {Abstract Sea level rise (SLR) will affect water levels and increase flood risk in river deltas. To adapt river deltas to SLR, various strategies can be followed. Many urbanised river deltas already have flood protection in place. Continuing a protection strategy under an increasing SLR, would mean higher embankments along the coast and rivers and possibly closing off the river mouths from the sea. However, closing of rivers will hamper the river flow. How to adapt river deltas and enabling rivers to discharge into the sea is a challenging question. This paper assesses impacts of SLR on flood risks in the Rhine-Meuse Delta in the Netherlands in case the current protection strategy is continued and explores two alternative protection strategies: (1) a closed system with pumps and discharge sluices and (2) an open system in which rivers are diverted to less densely populated areas. The second alternative results in a more flexible river delta, which can accommodate larger SLR. The paper shows that a systems approach and using quantitative assessments of the implications of strategies is possible. This is needed to further assess the adaptation options, so we can anticipate and adapt when needed and avoid regret of decisions.},

	school =   {Delft University of Technology},
	year =     {2017},
	abstract = {In the Rhine-Meuse Delta in the Netherlands, deep scour holes can develop very suddenly. The holes may form a potential risk for the stability of surrounding riverbanks, dikes, bridges, tunnels and buildings. A scour hole can mostly be the result of two conditions: local changes in hydrodynamical conditions or local changes in erosive capacity of the bed. Heterogeneity of the subsoil in the Rhine-Meuse Delta causes differences in erosive capacity, resulting the formation of deep scour holes. A distinct method to predict the development of scour holes in heterogeneous subsoil is not found yet. In this research a numerical model that simulates the hydrodynamics in a scour hole is used to gain more insight in the flow processes that are present in such a hole. The dependencies of the flow processes on the upstream water depth, upstream flow velocity and depth of the scour hole are investigated by changing these parameters systematically in the model simulations. The processes that are included in the analysis are the flow separation and recirculation zone, the contraction of flow, the horseshoe vortex and the vortices downstream of the hole. Changes in the depth of the scour hole showed some interesting phenomena. It is found that three-dimensional processes suppress the formation of the recirculation zone, as flow separation happened for milder slopes and shallower holes in two-dimensional simulations. The contraction of flow is not necessarily stronger for larger holes, which was hypothesized. The analysis of the bed shear stress in the model results shows a constant upstream slope angle, as the critical value for bed shear stress is not reached. In the downstream half of the hole, this value is reached and therefore erosion and sedimentation are expected. The bed shear stress in the model results shows strips of zero bed shear stress with large gradients at both sides of the hole. These strips have an angle of 1:8, which is also found in the laboratory experiments by Koopmans (2017). The downstream expansion of the scour hole with a poorly erodible top layer had the same widening angle.},

The interFoam evaluation model addressed the issues of computational mesh types which affect the simulation results, and the methods for regulation of water level at the downstream boundary. The two types of the meshes which are used in the research are structured non-orthogonal mesh and unstructured more-orthogonal mesh. The benchmark test is the flow over the weir in the flume. The use of a non-orthogonal mesh could simulate the flow separation which is found downstream of the weir. However the unstructured meshes which are composed of more orthogonal parts and less non-orthogonal parts, could not reproduce the flow separation in 2D simulations correctly for high and small specific discharges. For the 3D simulations, the unstructured meshes apparently simulate the correct flow profile for low specific discharges. In this interFoam evaluation model the control structure or gate is used for maintaining the water level at the downstream boundary. In other words, it uses the physical method of water level boundary condition. The weir-groyne comparison model is developed with different settings from the former model for the assessment of the differences between weirs and groynes in open-channel flumes. The water level is regulated by a trial-and-error discharge adjustment method making use of inlet and outlet tanks. The mesh type used is the unstructured more-orthogonal mesh in 3D simulations since the severely non-orthogonal meshes introduce numerical artifacts. A variety of weirs and groynes with different slopes are simulated for the comparison of energy losses and streamlines patterns. From the simulation results, the streamlines of the flow over the weir and the groyne are found to be different and the energy head losses also differ between these two structures. For recommendations, to evaluate the skill of the interFoam solver the 3D simulations for unstructured meshes should be carried out to make sure that they can reproduce the flow sep- aration correctly. The use of a mathematical boundary condition for defining the water level is recommended to avoid the extra computational power for the control structure. To acquire the knowledge of flow around groynes and weirs, the experimental set-ups are recommended, and well-proved non-linear k − ε and k − ω turbulence closure models should be applied in the numerical modellings.},

Analytical steady states solutions (both lake at rest and non vanishing velocity) are deduced an approximated with the proposed scheme. In all the presented tests, the computational efforts are notably reduced thanks to the proposed method without losing the accuracy in the results.},

The study includes test cases with known analytical solutions (generated with the method of manufactured solutions) corresponding to laminar and turbulent flow, with the latter using eddy-viscosity turbulence models. The procedure to perform Code Verification based on grid refinement studies is discussed and the requirements for its correct application are illustrated in a simple one-dimensional problem. It is shown that geometrically similar grids are recommended for proper Code Verification and so the data should not have scatter making the use of least square fits unnecessary. Results show that it may be advantageous to determine the extrapolated error to cell size/time step zero instead of assuming that it is zero, especially when it is hard to determine the asymptotic order of grid convergence. In the RANS examples, several of the features of the ReFRESCO solver are checked including the effects of the available turbulence models in the convergence properties of the code. It is shown that it is required to account for non-orthogonality effects in the discretization of the diffusion terms and that the turbulence quantities transport equations can deteriorate the order of grid convergence of mean flow quantities.},

  abstract = {Abstract Channel bifurcations can be found in river network systems from high gradient gravel-bed rivers to fine-grained low gradient deltas. In these systems, bifurcations often evolve asymmetrically such that one downstream channel silts up and the other deepens and, in most cases, they eventually avulse. Past analytical and numerical studies showed that symmetric bifurcations are unstable in high and low Shields stress conditions resulting in asymmetric bifurcations and avulsion, while they can be stable in the mid-Shields range, but this range is smaller for larger width-to-depth ratio. Here, using a one-dimensional (1D) numerical model, we show that effects of sediment grain size and of channel slope are much larger than expected for low-gradient systems when a sediment transport relation is used that separates between bedload and suspended load transport. We found that the range of Shields stress conditions with unstable symmetric bifurcations expanded for lower channel slopes and for finer sediment. In high sediment mobility, suspended load increasingly dominates the sediment transport, which increases the sediment transport nonlinearity and lowers the relative influence of the stabilizing transverse bedslope-driven flux. Contrary to previous works, we found another stable symmetric solution in high Shields stress, but this only occurs in the systems with small width-to-depth ratio. This indicates that suspended load-dominated bifurcations of lowland rivers are more likely to develop into highly asymmetric channels than previously thought. This explains the tendency of channel avulsion observed in many systems.},

	abstract = {In the Rhine-Meuse delta many scour holes are present. These scour holes form a potential risk on the surrounding bridges, levees, weirs, dikes and tunnels. In general, scour holes can develop when there is a local change in hydrodynamic conditions or erosive capacity. Extensive research has been done in the past on scour holes close to hydraulic structures in a homogeneous subsoil, however, a large amount of scour holes are not related to hydraulic structures. Additionally, in deltas, the subsoil mostly consists of alternating layers of soil with different erosive capacities. This experimental study focused on a simplified situation of scour holes in heterogeneous subsoil with a three-dimensional character. The bed of the flume consisted of a concrete layer with a hole in the centre in which sand was exposed to the flow. Water depth, flow velocity and the size of the geometry were systematically varied to investigate their influence on scour hole development. Additionally, general observations were performed on the flow structures and scour development in and around the scour hole. It was observed that the scour development is different compared to the results of earlier investigations as a result of the non-erodible top layer. The process of undermining is a limiting factor for sediment transport out of the scour hole. The water depth showed a significantly smaller influence on the scour depth compared to existing empirical formulas. Additionally, the size of the geometry seems to be the most important varied parameter in this study. Relative to the size of the geometry, the scour depth remained approximately equal with different experimental conditions. Compared to two-dimensional experiments, the scour holes became deeper, which suggests importance of three-dimensional flow for scour hole development.},

abstract = {Abstract Scour holes often form in shallow flows over sand on the beach and in morphodynamic scale experiments of river reaches, deltas and estuarine landscapes. The scour holes are on average 2 cm deep and 5 cm long, regardless of the flow depth and appear to occur under similar conditions as current ripples: at low boundary Reynolds numbers, in fine sand and under relatively low sediment mobility. In landscape experiments, where the flow is only about 1 cm deep, such scours may be unrealistically large and have unnatural effects on channel formation, bar pattern and stratigraphy. This study tests the hypotheses that both scours and ripples occur in the same conditions and that the roughness added by sediment saltation explains the difference between the ripple–dune transition and the clear-water hydraulic smooth to rough transition. About 500 experiments are presented with a range of sediment types, sediment mobility and obstructions to provoke scour holes, or removal thereof to assess scour hole persistence. Most experiments confirm that ripples and scour holes both form in the ripple stability field in two different bedform stability diagrams. The experiments also show that scours can be provoked by perturbations even below generalized sediment motion. Moreover, the hydraulic smooth to rough transition modified with saltation roughness depending on sediment mobility was similar in magnitude and in slope to ripple–dune transitions. Given uncertainties in saltation relations, the smooth to rough transitions modified for movable beds are empirically equivalent to the ripple–dune transitions. These results are in agreement with the hypothesis that scours form by turbulence caused by localized flow separation under low boundary Reynolds numbers, and do not form under generalized flow separation over coarser particles and intense sediment saltation. Furthermore, this suggests that ripples are a superposition of two independent forms: periodic bedforms occurring in smooth and rough conditions plus aperiodic scours occurring only in hydraulic smooth conditions.},

  abstract = {Abstract Human interference in estuaries has led to increasing problems of mud, such as hyper-turbidity with adverse ecological effects and siltation of navigation channels and harbours. To deal with this mud sustainably, it is important to understand its long-term effects on the morphology and dynamics of estuaries. The aim of this study is to understand how mud affects the morphological evolution of estuaries. We focus on the effects of fluvial mud supply on the spatial distribution of mudflats and on how this influences estuary width, depth, surface area and dynamics over time. Three physical experiments with self-forming channels and shoals were conducted in a new flume type suitable for tidal experiments: the Metronome. In two of the experiments, we added nutshell grains as mud simulant, which is transported in suspension. Time-lapse images of every tidal cycle and digital elevation models for every 500 cycles were analysed for the three experiments. Mud settles in distinct locations, forming mudflats on bars and sides of the estuary, where the bed elevation is higher. Two important effects of mud were observed: the first is the slight cohesiveness of mud that causes stability on bars limiting vertical erosion, although the bank erosion rate by migrating channels is unaffected. Secondly, mud fills inactive areas and deposits at higher elevations up to the high-water level and therefore decreases the tidal prism. These combined effects cause a decrease in dynamics in the estuary and lead to near-equilibrium planforms that are smaller in volume and especially narrower upstream, with increased bar heights and no channel deepening. This trend is in contrast to channel deepening in rivers by muddier floodplain formation. These results imply large consequences for long-term morphodynamics in estuaries that become muddier due to management practices, which deteriorate ecological quality of intertidal habitats but may create potential area for marshes. © 2018 The Authors.

The study area covers a 5-km reach of the Santa Bárbara River located in the Ecuadorian Andes, at 2330 masl, in Gualaceo. The model's performance was evaluated based on the water surface elevation and flood extent, in terms of the mean absolute difference and measure of fit. The analysis revealed that, for a given case, Iber 2D has the best performance in simulating the water level and inundation for flood events with 20- and 50-year return periods, respectively, followed by Flood Modeller 2D, HEC-RAS 2D, and PCSWMM 2D in terms of their performance. Grid resolution, the way in which hydraulic structures are mimicked, the model code, and the default value of the parameters are considered the main sources of prediction uncertainty.},

RIVICE is a one-dimensional, fully-dynamic wave model that mimics key river ice processes such as ice generation, ice transport, ice cover progression (shoving, submergence and juxtapositioning) and ice jam formation, details of which are highlighted in the text. Three ice jam events at Fort McMurray, Alberta, along the Athabasca River, are used as case studies to illustrate the steps of model setup, model calibration and results interpretation. A local sensitivity analysis reveals the varying effects of parameter and boundary conditions on backwater flood levels as a function of the location of ice jam lodgment along the river reach and the location along the ice jam cover. Some limitations of the model and suggestions for future research and model development conclude the paper.},

  abstract = {Both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) comprehensive river ice process models exist, commercially and within the public domain. 2D models provide a better representation of the variability of river ice processes in complex natural channel systems. However, they are not typically applied to long reaches or channel networks because costly field data and lengthy computational time render them operationally impractical. Most existing 1D river ice process models typically solve unsteady flow equations using implicit finite difference schemes (e.g. CRISSP1D (Shen, 2006); MIKE11-ICE (Theriault et al., 2010; Timalsina et al., 2013); and RIVICE (Lindenschmidt, 2017)) that may become unstable when the flow approaches critical or for mixed subcritical/supercritical flow situations. In order to prevent model instabilities in these cases, techniques such as the local partial inertia (LPI) technique (Fread et al., 1996) are applied to the finite difference solution to suppress the inertial terms in the Saint-Venant equations so that the solution is reduced to the more stable but less accurate diffusive wave description. River1D: The model was originally developed as an open water hydrodynamic model, solving the Saint-Venant equation using the characteristic-dissipative-Galerkin (CDG) finite element scheme (Hicks and Steffler, 1990, 1992).},

abstract = {This paper aims to present the extension of the non-hydrostatic wave-flow model SWASH with the covolume method to build discretization schemes on unstructured triangular grids. Central to this method that is free of spurious pressure modes, is the use of dual pairs of meshes that are mutually orthogonal, such as the Delaunay-Voronoi mesh systems. The approximants sought are the components of the flow velocity vector normal to the cell faces of the primal mesh. In addition to the covolume approach, a novel upwind difference scheme for the horizontal advection terms in the momentum equation is proposed. This scheme obeys the Rankine-Hugoniot jump relations and prevents the odd-even decoupling of the velocity field accordingly. Moreover, cases with flow discontinuities, such as steady bores and broken waves, are properly treated. In spite of the low-order accuracy of the proposed method, unstructured meshes easily allow for local refinement in a way that retains the desired accuracy. The unstructured-grid version of SWASH is applicable to a wide range of 2DH wave-flow problems to investigate the nonlinear dynamics of free surface waves over varying bathymetries. Its efficiency and robustness is tested on a number of these problems employing unstructured triangular meshes.},

  abstract = {Depth-averaged models, such as the Savage-Hutter model with Coulomb or Pouliquen friction laws, do not in some cases preserve the physical threshold of motion. In particular, the simulated granular mass can start to flow (or stay at rest) even if the slope angle of its free surface is lower (or higher) than the repose angle of the granular material involved. The problem is related to the hydrostatic pressure assumption, associated with the direction of integration, which is orthogonal to a reference plane or a reference bottom. We propose here an initial method to correct this misleading behavior. Firstly, we define a correction of the friction term that accounts for the Jacobian of a change of coordinates, making it possible to reproduce the physical threshold of motion and thus the solutions at rest. Secondly, we observe that the 3D model presented in [F. Bouchut, I. Ionescu, and A. Mangeney. An analytic approach for the evolution of the static-flowing interface in viscoplastic granular flows. Commun, Math. Sci., 14(8):2101–2126, 2016] verifies the physical thresholds of motion because it is based on a second order correction of the pressure valid for slow granular flows. The correction proposed here ensures that the model preserves, up to the second order, the physical threshold of motion defined by the repose angle of the material. Several numerical tests are presented to illustrate certain problems related to classical depth averaged models and the remedial effect of the proposed correction, in particular through comparisons with experimental data. We finally show that this correction is not exact far from the starting and stopping phases of the granular avalanche and should be improved by adding other second order terms in the pressure approximation.},

In particular, the Exner equation is taken into account either in the acoustic and transport steps, or only at the acoustic or transport level.

abstract = {Abstract In this paper we utilize a numerical morphological simulation approach to study braiding channel dynamics under steady flow. We conduct 11 different runs in a laboratory configuration, with each initial condition featuring a unique small-amplitude perturbation pattern of the bed topography. From these infinitesimal initial differences, braided channels evolve into patterns that are macroscopically different and unique to each run, thus showing sensitive dependence on the initial condition and hence a chaotic behavior. Leveraging the analogy of braiding and fluid turbulence put forward by Paola [1996], by introducing a Reynolds-type decomposition of bed elevations into a reference and a fluctuating component we characterize braided channel dynamics through statistics of bed fluctuations. We observe that, over the simulation time frame, braiding is not statistically homogeneous, but is stationary in a spatially-averaged sense. We prove that braiding is anisotropic and extract two distinct length scales associated with the correlations of bed fluctuations in the streamwise and cross-channel direction. We observe that, under the time averaging window that yields stationary braiding, braiding shows hints of ergodic behavior, as the time statistics of one run converge to the ensemble statistics computed across all the other runs.},

A shallow-water flow model is employed and bedload sediment transport is assumed. The mathematical structure of the linear problem, in terms of the eigenvalues and their associated eigenvectors is explored in detail and information is gathered on the wavespeed and growth rate of the perturbations as a function of their wavelength and of the relevant flow and sediment parameters. Several aspects of the solution are discussed, with particular focus on the behaviour in the transcritical region where the Froude number approaches unity. An approximate solution for the roots of the eigenrelationship is presented, which is not uniformly valid in the transcritical region, leading to the appearance of an unphysical instability. A regular perturbation expansion is then introduced that allows for the elimination of this singularity.},

  abstract = {Abstract Pressures on braided river systems in New Zealand are increasing due to anthropogenic stresses such as demand for irrigation water, braidplain conversion to farmland and invasive vegetation, as well as extreme natural events associated with earthquakes and climate change. These pressures create issues around preserving braided river physical environments and associated ecosystems, and managing hazards such as floods, aggradation and erosion. A need for more robust understanding and quantification of braided river morphodynamic processes underpins many of these issues. Here, we present eight morphodynamic research challenges to service this need. The first four research challenges relate to managing aggradation-related flooding hazards; the last four address issues stem largely from recent dairy expansion, which has created huge pressure to take land and irrigation water from the alp-fed braided rivers and to alter flow regimes at their mouths. Hāpua, the freshwater lagoons found where most braided rivers meet the coast, show complex morphodynamic behaviour in response to the interplay of river and coastal processes, and their special ecosystems are sensitive to river flow and sediment load changes. We discuss how physical laboratory experiments and novel numerical modelling can help to understand the morphological processes braided rivers undergo, and we show how those research advances could inform planning and legal decisions to regulate land rights and irrigation water allocation on New Zealand's braidplains. We illustrate these environmental and engineering issues and research challenges with examples from the Kowhai, Waiho, Waiau, Rangitata and Hurunui Rivers. © 2020 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Abstract This article introduces a new semi-implicit, staggered finite volume scheme on unstructured meshes for the modelling of rapidly varied shallow water flows. Rapidly varied flows occur in the inundation of dry land during flooding situations. They typically involve bores and hydraulic jumps after obstacles such as road banks. Near such sudden flow transitions, the grid resolution is often low compared with the gradients of the bathymetry. Locally the hydrostatic pressure assumption may become invalid. In these situations, it is crucial to apply the correct conservation properties to obtain accurate results. An important feature of this scheme is therefore its ability to conserve momentum locally or, by choice, preserve constant energy head along a streamline. This is achieved using a special interpolation method and control volumes for momentum. The efficiency of inundation calculations with locally very high velocities, and in the case of unstructured meshes locally very small grid distances, is severely hampered by the Courant condition. This article provides a solution in the form of a locally implicit time integration for the advective terms that allows for an explicit calculation in most of the domain, while maintaining unconditional stability by implicit calculations only where necessary. The complex geometry of flooded urban areas asks for the flexibility of unstructured meshes. The efficient calculation of the pressure gradient in this, and other semi-implicit staggered schemes, requires, however, an orthogonality condition to be put on the grid. In this article a simple method is introduced to generate unstructured hybrid meshes that fulfil this requirement. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Rapidly varied ?ows occur, for instance, in hydraulic jumps and bores. Inundation of dry land implies sudden ?ow transitions due to obstacles such as road banks. Near such transitions the grid resolution is often low compared to the gradients of the bathymetry. In combination with the local invalidity of the hydrostatic pressure assumption, conservation properties become crucial. The scheme described here, combines the e?ciency of staggered grids with conservation properties so as to ensure accurate results for rapidly varied ?ows, as well as in expansions as in contractions. In ?ow expansions, a numerical approximation is applied that is consistent with the momentum principle. In ?ow contractions, a numerical approximation is applied that is consistent with the Bernoulli equation. Both approximations are consistent with the shallow water equations, so under suffciently smooth conditions they converge to the same solution. The resulting method is very e?cient for the simulation of large-scale inundations.},

It is not known which numerical schemes are affected in which circumstances, what causes carbuncles to appear and whether carbuncles are purely numerical artifacts or rather features of a continuum equation or model. This article presents evidence towards the latter: we propose that carbuncles are a special class of entropy solutions which can be physically correct in some circumstances. Using “filaments”, we trigger a single carbuncle in a new and more reliable way, and compute the structure in detail in similarity coordinates. We argue that carbuncles can, in some circumstances, be valid vanishing viscosity limits. Trying to suppress them is making a physical assumption that may be false.},

  abstract = {Abstract River dunes are wavelike features in sandy riverbeds that move slowly in a downstream direction. These bedforms are shaped by the interaction between flowing water and sand grains at the riverbed. Understanding river dune dynamics is essential to determine sediment transport and optimize river maintenance. Earlier research mainly focused on river dune dynamics during high flows; therefore, low-flow dune dynamics are hardly understood. In this study, we analyzed dune dynamics in a unique data set of 10 years of biweekly bed elevation profiles of the Rhine River, focusing on low-flow conditions. Here, we show that dunes migrate and become lower and longer during low flows, while current literature states that dunes should become shorter. This dune migration and lengthening at low flows is a new finding and is linked to diffusive dune migration processes that become more relevant when sediment transport is just above incipient motion.},

This is done by numerical modelling of a laboratory experiment and two thought experiments. Struiksma's model does not predict break-up and Hirano's model yields unrealistic results when part of the sediment is immobile. We propose two alternatives that overcome these limitations: the ILSE and HANNEKE models. They differ in the interpretation of the top part of the bed interacting with the flow. Moreover, only the HANNEKE model explicitly predicts the formation of coarse layers, at the expenses of a more limited application range.},

The mathematical description relies on the 6DOF equations, where Eulerian flows and a Lagrangian ship-tracking approach is used, coupling river features and the main characteristics of ships. For each time step, the resultant linear and angular momenta were calculated through analytical equations to measure the ship movement and other relevant parameters such as velocity and drift angle. An autopilot system was also developed to reproduce the necessary maneuvers during navigation. A German section of the Rhine River was used for verification. The model reproduced the main movements of vessels in restricted regions; therefore, one can estimate the set of parameters and necessary adaptations in rivers and ships that optimize safe commercial navigation for waterways projects.},

	abstract = {In the Rhine-Meuse delta many scour holes are present. These scour holes form a potential risk on the surrounding bridges, levees, weirs, dikes and tunnels. In general, scour holes can develop when there is a local change in hydrodynamic conditions or erosive capacity. Extensive research has been done in the past on scour holes close to hydraulic structures in a homogeneous subsoil, however, a large amount of scour holes are not related to hydraulic structures. Additionally, in deltas, the subsoil mostly consists of alternating layers of soil with different erosive capacities. This experimental study focused on a simplified situation of scour holes in heterogeneous subsoil with a three-dimensional character. The bed of the flume consisted of a concrete layer with a hole in the centre in which sand was exposed to the flow. Water depth, flow velocity and the size of the geometry were systematically varied to investigate their influence on scour hole development. Additionally, general observations were performed on the flow structures and scour development in and around the scour hole. It was observed that the scour development is different compared to the results of earlier investigations as a result of the non-erodible top layer. The process of undermining is a limiting factor for sediment transport out of the scour hole. The water depth showed a significantly smaller influence on the scour depth compared to existing empirical formulas. Additionally, the size of the geometry seems to be the most important varied parameter in this study. Relative to the size of the geometry, the scour depth remained approximately equal with different experimental conditions. Compared to two-dimensional experiments, the scour holes became deeper, which suggests importance of three-dimensional flow for scour hole development.},

The hydro-morphodynamic response of a beach to natural and artificial forcing factors differ considerably, as the nearshore processes are especially complex and depended on a multitude of parameters, including prevailing wave and hydrodynamic conditions, beach topography, sediment characteristics and the presence of coastal protection works. The present study serves the purpose of numerically evaluating nearshore morphological processes and ultimately assessing the capacity of coastal defence structures to control beach erosion. For this reason, a new sediment transport model including unsteady effects and swash zone morphodynamics, was coupled to the highly nonlinear Boussinesq wave model FUNWAVE-TVD, providing integrated predictions of bed level evolution, across various timescales of interest. The compound model was validated thoroughly against laboratory data and other numerical investigations. Overall, a good agreement between experimental and numerical results was achieved for a number of test cases, investigating the effects of different types of shore protection structures. The proposed integrated model can be a valuable tool for engineers and scientists desiring to obtain accurate bed level predictions, over complex mildly and steeply sloping sea bottoms composed of non-cohesive sediment particles.},

Since safety factors are commonly used to incorporate uncertainties into design, the relationship between the risk of failure and safety factors is examined. A best‐fit pier scour model, rather than a conservative model, is used to develop a probabilistic approach to pier scour engineering. An example is provided to demonstrate the probabilistic approach. The level of risk for a bridge pier design is provided by the development of safety factors that are a direct reflection of the desired or allowable level of risk.},

The major changes in the fifth edition of HEC-18 are: expanded discussion on the policy and regulatory basis for the FHWA Scour Program, including risk-based approaches for evaluations, developing Plans of Action (POAs) for scour critical bridges, and expanded discussion on countermeasure design philosophy (new vs. existing bridges). This fifth edition includes: a new section on contraction scour in cohesive materials, an updated abutment scour section, alternative abutment design approaches, alternative procedures for estimating pier scour, and new guidance on pier scour with debris loading. There is a new chapter on soils, rock and geotechnical considerations related to scour. Additional changes include: a new approach for pier scour in coarse material, new sections on pier scour in cohesive materials and pier scour in erodible rock, revised guidance for vertical contraction scour (pressure flow) conditions, guidance for predicting scour at bottomless culverts, deletion of the "General Scour" term, and revised discussion on scour at tidal bridges to reflect material now covered in HEC-25 (2nd Edition).},

Here we present the freeware basement version 3, a flexible tool for two-dimensional river simulations that bundles solvers for hydrodynamic, morphodynamic and scalar advection-diffusion processes. basement leverages different computational platforms (multi-core CPUs and graphics processing units GPUs) to enable the simulation of large domains and long-term river processes. The adoption of a fully costless workflow and a light GUI facilitate its broad utilization. We test its robustness and efficiency in a selection of benchmarks. Results confirm that basement could be an efficient and versatile tool for research, engineering practice and education in river modelling.},

We adapt the flux vector splitting approach of Toro and Vázquez-Cendón (2012) and identify one subsystem of conservative equations (advection system) and one of non-conservative equations (pressure system), both having a very simple eigenstructure compared to the full system. The final numerical scheme is constructed using a Godunov-type path-conservative scheme for the pressure system and a simple conservative Godunov method for the advection system and solved following a coupled solution strategy. The resulting first-order accurate method is extended to second order of accuracy in space and time via the ADER approach together with an AENO reconstruction technique. Accuracy, robustness and well-balanced properties of the resulting scheme are assessed through a carefully selected suite of testcases. The scheme is exceedingly simple, accurate and robust as the sophisticated Godunov methods. A distinctive feature of the novel scheme is its flexibility in the choice of the sediment transport closure formula, which makes it particularly attractive for scientific and engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Recent analysis of equilibrium and quasi-equilibrium channel geometry in engineered (fixed-width) rivers has successfully shown that two temporal scales can be distinguished, with quasi-static (long-term) and dynamic (short-term) components. This distinction is based on the fact that channel slope cannot keep pace with short-term fluctuations of the controls. Here we exploit the distinction between the two temporal scales to model the transient (so time-dependent) phase of channel response, which is the phase wherein the channel approaches its new equilibrium. We show that: (a) besides channel slope, also the bed surface texture cannot keep pace with short-term fluctuations of the controls, and (b) mean transient channel response is determined by the probability distributions of the controls (e.g., flow duration curve rather than flow rate sequence). These findings allow us to set up a rapid numerical method that determines the mean transient channel response under stochastic controls. The method is based on distinguishing modes (i.e., sets of controls) and takes the probability density of each mode into account. At each time step, we compute the mode-specific flow, sediment transport rate, and corresponding change in bed level and surface texture. The net change within the time step is computed by weighting the mode-specific changes in bed level and surface texture with the probability density of each mode. The resulting mean transient channel response is a deterministic one, despite the controls being stochastic variables. We show that the proposed method provides a rapid alternative to Monte Carlo analysis regarding the mean time-dependent channel response.},

  abstract     = {Present-day river forms and processes are in many cases conditioned by the consequences of anthropogenic modifications such as dams, embankments and gravel mining. Fluvial geomorphologists have typically investigated the effects of these human impacts using a so-called expert-based approach, whereby observed association or synchronicity between geomorphological changes and a given, preidentified impact, are interpreted as evidence of causation. This approach has important limitations when the effects of multiple human interventions interact along the same river corridor or overlap with the legacy of natural changes affecting the sediment - water balance. In such situations, the establishment of causal links between channel morphology and single impacts is not as straightforward as commonly assumed and the conclusions are susceptible to ‘confirmation biases’. In this paper we highlight this risk through an assessment of human impacts on the Rhône River within a multi-driver context. The French Rhône is an excellent example of an Anthropocene river impacted by two main development phases during the twentieth century: embankments (1890s–1930s) followed by a series of multiple dams (1950s–1990s). We began by laying out several geomorphologically consistent hypotheses for the geomorphological trajectory of the Rhône over the twentieth century. Next, we tested these hypotheses against grain size data collected in the field in a structured and hypothesis-oriented way. Using this hypothesis-driven and deductive attribution analysis we identified the relative impacts of the different development phases on the present-day grain size distribution and in particular on armouring in the Rhône River, and proposed a hierarchy of dominant drivers of geomorphological change along the Rhone over the last century and a half. Our results led us to conclude that in the case of the Rhône, the effect of dams on armouring was negligible compared to a legacy of natural heritages and embankments.},

  abstract     = {Recent growth of the construction industry has fuelled the demand for sand, with considerable volumes being extracted from the world’s large rivers. Sediment transport from upstream naturally replenishes sediment stored in river beds, but the absence of sand flux data from large rivers inhibits assessment of the sustainability of ongoing sand mining. Here, we demonstrate that bedload (0.18 ± 0.07 Mt yr−1) is a small (1%) fraction of the total annual sediment load of the lower Mekong River. Even when considering suspended sand (6 ± 2 Mt yr−1), the total sand flux entering the Mekong delta (6.18 ± 2.01 Mt yr−1) is far less than current sand extraction rates (50 Mt yr−1). We show that at these current rates, river bed levels can be lowered sufficiently to induce river bank instability, potentially damaging housing and infrastructure and threatening lives. Our research suggests that on the Mekong and other large rivers subject to excessive sand mining, it is imperative to establish regulatory frameworks that limit extraction rates to levels that permit the establishment of a sustainable balance between the natural supply/storage of sand and the rate at which sand is removed.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Channel geometry, flow and sedimentation in a meander bend of the River South Esk were studied from bankfull stages (January–February) to low water stages (May) in 1974. Bed topography varied little over the study period, showing a typical pool and ripple geometry. Variation of mean depth and velocity with discharge differed from section to section around the bend, due primarily to locally varying flow resistance with stage. The flow pattern for all stages was dominated by a single spiral over the point bar, with a development zone at the bend entrance. Deviation of bed shear stress from the mean flow direction was in general accord with theory, especially for high stages. The use of a uniform longitudinal water surface slope in the calculation of bed shear stress is not justified because of a complicated water surface topography, also such calculated shear may not represent effective bed shear on grains, as it accounts also for energy losses associated with secondary flows. Dunes covered much of the bar at high stages, with increasing proportions of ripples, sand ribbons and lower phase plane beds at low stages. Local flow resistance generally decreases from dunes, diminished and ripple-backed dunes, ripples, sand ribbons to plane beds, and bed forms are predicted quite well by the stream power-grain size scheme. Mean size, sorting and skewness of sediment over the bed changes little with stage. In general, size decreases, sorting improves and skewness changes from positive to negative from the talweg to the inner bank, and in the downstream direction. Allen's (1970a, b) force balance equation for moving bed load particles is supported for bankfull stage, with some reservations, and textural characteristics are explained by progressive sorting in the direction of sediment transport. Large-scale trough cross stratification (with some flat bedding) formed at high stage by dunes (and lower phase plane beds) dominates the point bar sediments. Alternations of fine-medium sand (often cross-laminated) and vegetation-rich layers result from periodic deposition on the grassed upper bar surface. Fining upwards sequences produced by lateral channel migration are modified by a coarsening upward subsequence in the upstream bar region where spiral flow is developing from the bend upstream.},

This comes about even though inertial forces due to local bed topography delay crossing of the boundary shear stress maximum to a position farther downstream than would otherwise be expected. Measured bedform migration rates reflect the boundary shear stress field, and in this river, bedform crest orientations respond to gradients in the shear stress field by becoming oblique to the general flow direction. When so aligned the bedforms interact with the helical flow in the curved channel and induce a near bottom secondary current which, in the upstream part of the bend, is outward above the crests and inward along the troughs. At the downstream end of the bend this pattern is reversed and significant quantities of sediment are transported along troughs from one point bar to the next. This near bottom flow pattern imposes a cross-isobath, zig-zag trajectory on the sediment grains and sorts the bed material. Further, it provides a realizable mechanism for maintenance of equilibrium channel geometry in streams with bedforms.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT There is a paucity of data and insight in the mechanisms of, and controls on flow separation and recirculation at natural sharply-curved river bends. Herein we report on successful laboratory experiments that elucidate flow structure in one constant-width bend and a second bend with an outer-bank widening. The experiments were performed with both a flat immobile gravel bed and mobile sand bed with dominant bedload sediment transport. In the constant-width bend with immobile bed, a zone of mainly horizontal flow separation (vertical rotational axis) formed at the inner bank that did not contain detectable flow recirculation, and an outer-bank cell of secondary flow with streamwise oriented rotational axis. Surprisingly, the bend with widening at the outer bank and immobile bed did not lead to a transverse expansion of the flow. Rather, flow in the outer-bank widening weakly recirculated around a vertical axis and hardly interacted with the inner part of the bend, which behaved as a constant-width bend. In the mobile bed experiment, downstream of the bend apex a pronounced depositional bar developed at the inside of the bend and pronounced scour occurred at the outside. Moreover the deformed bed promoted flow separation over the bar, including return currents. In the constant-width bend, the topographic steering impeded the generation of an outer-bank cell of secondary flow. In the bend with outer-bank widening, the topographic steering induced an outward expansion of the flow, whereby the major part of the discharge was conveyed in the central part of the widening section. Flow in the outer-bank widening was highly three dimensional and included return currents near the bottom. In conclusion, the experiments elucidated three distinct processes of flow separation common in sharp bends: flow separation at the inner bank, an outer-bank cell of secondary flow, and flow separation and recirculation in an outer-bank widening.

The formulation of the Junction Riemann Problem (JRP) under subsonic conditions in 1D flow is clearly defined and solved by current methods, but they fail when sonic or supersonic conditions appear. Formulations coupling the 1D model for the vessels or pipes with other container-like formulations for junctions have been presented, requiring extra information such as assumed bulk mechanical properties and geometrical properties or the extension to more dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, in this work, the JRP is solved for the first time allowing solutions for all types of transitions and for any number of vessels, without requiring the definition of any extra information. The resulting JRP solver is theoretically well-founded, robust and simple, and returns the evolving state for the conserved variables in all vessels, allowing the use of any numerical method in the resolution of the inner cells used for the space-discretization of the vessels. The methodology of the proposed solver is presented in detail. The JRP solver is directly applicable if energy losses at the junctions are defined. Straightforward extension to other 1D hyperbolic flows can be performed.},

  abstract = {Abstract The sediment composition of the seabed governs its mobility, hence determining sediment transport and morphological evolution of estuaries and tidal basins. Bed sediments often consist of mixtures of sand and mud, with spatial gradients in the sand/mud content. This study aims at increasing the understanding of processes driving the sediment composition in tidal basins, focusing on depositional processes. We show that bed sediments in the Wadden Sea tend to be either mud-dominated or sand-dominated, resulting in a bimodal distribution of the mud content where the two modes represent equilibrium conditions. The equilibria depend primarily on the sediment deposition fluxes, with bimodality originating from the dependence of suspended sand/mud concentrations on the local bed composition. Our analysis shows that bimodality is a phenomenon that is not only specific for the Wadden Sea; it can be expected for a wide range of suspended sediment concentrations and thus also in other systems worldwide.},

In particular, we clearly explain why this inaccuracy problem concerns the 2D or 3D geometry and does not concern the 1D geometry. The theoretical arguments are based on the Hodge decomposition, on the fact that an appropriate well-prepared subspace is invariant for the linear wave equation and on the notion of first-order modified equation. This theoretical approach allows to propose a simple modification that can be applied to any colocated scheme of Godunov type or not in order to define a large class of colocated schemes accurate at low Mach number on any mesh. It also allows to justify colocated schemes that are accurate at low Mach number as, for example, the Roe–Turkel and the AUSM+-up schemes, and to find a link with a colocated incompressible scheme stabilized with a Brezzi–Pitkäranta type stabilization. Numerical results justify the theoretical arguments proposed in this paper.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Many models of river meander migration rely upon a simple formalism, whereby the eroding bank is cut back at a rate that is dictated by the flow, and the depositing bank then migrates passively in response, so as to maintain a constant bankfull channel width. Here a new model is presented, in which separate relations are developed for the migration of the eroding bank and the depositing bank. It is assumed that the eroding bank consists of a layer of fine-grained sediment that is cohesive and/or densely riddled with roots, underlain by a purely noncohesive layer of sand and/or gravel. Following erosion of the noncohesive layer, the cohesive layer fails in the form of slump blocks, which armor the noncohesive layer and thereby moderate the erosion rate. If the slump block material breaks down or is fluvially entrained, the protection it provides for the noncohesive layer diminishes and bank erosion is renewed. Renewed bank erosion, however, rejuvenates slump block armoring. At the depositing bank, it is assumed that all the sediment delivered to the edge of vegetation due to the transverse component of sediment transport is captured by encroaching vegetation, which is not removed by successive floods. Separate equations describing the migration of the eroding and depositing banks are tied to a standard morphodynamic formulation for the evolution of the flow and bed in the central region of the channel. In this model, the river evolves toward maintenance of roughly constant bankfull width as it migrates only to the extent that the eroding bank and depositing bank ‘talk’ to each other via the medium of the morphodynamics of the channel center region. The model allows for both (a) migration for which erosion widens the channel, forcing deposition at the opposite bank, and (b) migration for which deposition narrows the channel forcing erosion at the opposite bank.

  abstract     = {Abstract Distinct bankline patterns appeared after the removal of protection works along a navigable reach of the Meuse River. A series of oblique embayments now dominate the riverine landscape after ten years of bank erosion, but their location and asymmetry cannot be explained yet. This work analyses and integrates field measurements of flow, ship waves, bank composition, bed topography and historical maps to explain the observed patterns along two reaches of the river. An extraordinary low-water-level event generated by a ship accident provided the unique opportunity to also analyse the subaqueous bank topography. The results indicate that the formation of oblique embayments arises from the combination of floodplain heterogeneity, structured by scroll-bar deposits, and the regulation of water levels, resulting in ship-wave attack at a narrow range of bank elevation for 70\% of the time. Substrate erodibility acts on the effectiveness of trees to slow down local bank erosion rates, which is possibly enhanced by a positive feedback between woody roots and cohesive soil. The strong regulation of water levels and the waves generated by the intense ship traffic produce an increasingly long mildly-sloping terrace at the bank toe and progressively dominate the bank erosion process. This study demonstrates the important role of floodplain and scroll bar formation in shaping later bank erosion, which has implications for predictive numerical models, restoration strategies, and understanding the role of vegetation in bank erosion processes. © 2019 The Authors.

Adv Water Resour 2008;31(3):447–54], the authors analytically inverted the depth–specific energy and depth–total force relationships for flows in open channels with wide rectangular cross-sections. In the present work, the previous results are extended using a simple analytical perturbation technique to the important class of power-law cross-sections, which can often be used to approximate real fluvial geometry. Assuming the river cross-section slightly different from the rectangular form, the exponent of the power-law defining the river cross-section is subsequently small. The expressions for the specific energy and total force as functions of the water depth are considered in dimensionless form. The inversion of these functions begins with the exact analytical solutions for wide rectangular sections. A perturbation analysis is carried out taking the exponent of the power-law as a small parameter. For a known discharge and for each meaningful value of the specific energy, a subcritical and a supercritical depth are analytically determined, expanding the depth in terms of this small parameter up to the second-order. Similarly, for each meaningful value of the total force, a subcritical and a supercritical depth are found analytically, also using a second-order expansion of the flow depth. Examples from classical open channel hydraulics show the consistency of these analytical solutions. An error analysis is presented to provide limits of presented solutions and an analytical technique is proposed to further refine the solutions.},

A hybrid cut-cell/ghost-cell method is used together with a direction-splitting implicit solver: Ghost cells are used for the momentum equations in order to prescribe the correct boundary condition at the immersed boundary, while cut cells are used in the continuity equation in order to conserve mass. The resulting scheme is robust, does not suffer any time step limitation for small cut cells, and conserves fluid mass up to machine precision. Moreover, the solver displays a second-order spatial accuracy, both globally and locally. Comparisons with analytical solutions and reference numerical solutions on curvilinear grids confirm the quality of the method. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Abstract Meandering gravel-bed rivers tend to exhibit bed surface sorting patterns with coarse particles located in pools and fine particles on bar tops. The mechanism by which these patterns emerge has been explored in sand-bed reaches; however, for gravel-bed meandering channels it remains poorly understood. Here we present results from a flume experiment in which bed morphology, velocity, sediment sorting patterns, and bed load transport were intensively documented. The experimental channel is 1.35 m wide, 15.2 m long, and its centerline follows a sine-generated curve with a crossing angle of 20°. Water and sediment input were held constant throughout the experiment and measurements were collected under quasi-equilibrium conditions. Boundary shear stress calculated from near-bed velocity measurements indicates that in a channel with mild sinuosity, deposition of fine particles on bars is a result of divergent shear stress at the inside bend of the channel, downstream of the apex. Boundary shear stress in the upstream half of the pool was below critical for coarse particles (>8 mm), leading to an armored pool. Inward directed selective transport was responsible for winnowing of fine particles in the pool. Fine and coarse sediment followed similar trajectories through the meander bend, which contrasts earlier studies of sand-bedded meanders where the loci of fine and coarse particles cross paths. This suggests a different sorting mechanism for gravel bends. This experiment shows that a complex interaction of quasi-equilibrium bed topography, selective sediment transport, and secondary currents are responsible for the sorting patterns seen in gravel-bed, meandering channels.},

This book presents the original ideas about the field of hydroinformatics, primarily introduced in the works of Abbott, together with critical assessment of its current developments.The first chapter re-visits the motivations for establishing the field of hydroinformatics, together with an assessment of current research and practice regarding the extent and characteristics that relate to the original ideas introduced by Abbott. Six following chapters have similar structure, each addressing a particular aspect of hydroinformatics, as follows: computational hydraulics and its role in establishing hydroinformatics, integration of artificial intelligence and computational hydraulics, hydroinformatics contributions to hydrology, transformations of water professions and businesses by hydroinformatics, hydroinformatics developments in China, and evolution and key characteristics of hydroinformatics education. Each chapter relates to already published works of Abbott. All chapters are written by contributors who were past collaborators of Abbott and are still active in the field of hydroinformatics.The second part of the book contains seven articles written by Abbott (some with his collaborators), selected to cover as broadly as possible the wide spectrum of Abbott's contributions to computational hydraulics and hydroinformatics. The book is a tribute to Abbott's contributions to hydroinformatics, and it provides an assessment of the current status of the field, perceived from within the context of Abbott's original ideas.}"},

Mike Abbott's contributions to the scientific development of numerical methods and computational techniques are described. These contributions led to the publication of his seminal work Computational Hydraulics - Elements of the Theory of Free Surface Flows in 1979. At the same time, the authors of this chapter have all worked closely with Mike Abbott to translate his sometimes-esoteric writings into practical and commercially viable solutions. An important milestone in this journey was the establishment of the Computational Hydraulics Centre at the Danish Hydraulics Institute in 1970, which was a result of the recognition of the commercial importance of computational hydraulics and the need for further professionalization of the development of modelling systems. This was witnessed through the development of modelling systems like, for example, System21 (later MIKE 21) and the Système Hydrologique Européen (MIKE SHE). When tracing the development of computational hydraulics, Mike Abbott often referred to a number of generations of modelling methodologies and corresponding models, which has led to the current, fourth-generation modelling systems. Furthermore, as a natural progression of computational hydraulics, he discussed at length the developing social dimension of hydraulics and hydraulic modelling, which was seen as a first and necessary step towards hydroinformatics. This chapter concludes with an assessment of the extent to which the anticipated benefits of fourth-generation modelling may or may not have come to fruition and what this has meant in daily practice. These lessons learned are placed in the context of what this then means for future hydroinformatics applications.}"},

	abstract  =  {"{The strengthening dominance of electronics over past several decades has resulted in an almost total dominance of digital representation of the hydro-environment. Recognizing these developments, Mike Abbott introduced the notion of electronic encapsulation of information and knowledge. The act of encapsulating information and knowledge changes the very nature of the information and knowledge involved. Suffice to say that electronic encapsulation must also change the way in which an engineer accesses and uses the available information and knowledge. There is a shift in paradigm away from a model-based approach to a more data-based approach. Adopting such foundational considerations as its core, hydroinformatics opened research to the latest IT developments in the fields of artificial intelligence (including machine learning, evolutionary algorithms and artificial neural networks), artificial life, cellular or finite-state automata and other, previously unrelated sciences and technologies. Through studying and exploiting elements of these, at first sight unrelated, sciences, hydroinformatics produced new and innovative solutions to hydraulic and hydrological problems, as represented by real-time control and diagnosis, real-time forecasting, calibration of numerical models, data analysis and parameter estimation. In particular, the new approaches are able to generate important components of physically based, modelling systems by inducing models or sub-models of individual physical processes based only upon measured data. These (sub)models may then replace whole systems of complex, non-linear, differential equations that would otherwise require great skills from the modeller to calibrate, and powerful computing devices to solve. This chapter captures evolution of data science and AI within the field of hydroinformatics and provides an outline of the present state-of-affairs together with some ideas for future directions. The chapter outlines tangible solutions that have been applied by the hydroinformatics community to address specific challenges in hydro-environmental systems.}"},

  abstract  = {The first research topic in this thesis is the development of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element methods for partial differential equations containing nonconservative products, which are present in many two-phase flow models. For this, we combine the theory of Dal Maso, LeFloch and Murat, in which a definition is given for nonconservative products even where the solution field is discontinuous. This theory also provides the mathematical foundation for a new DG finite element method. For this new DG method, we show standard (p+1)-order convergence results using p-th order basis-functions for test-cases of which we know the exact solution. We also show its ability to deal with more complex test cases. Finally, we apply the method to a depth-averaged two-phase flow model of which the numerical results are qualitatively validated against results obtained from a laboratory experiment. The second topic of this thesis is multigrid. The use of multigrid is of great importance to obtain efficient solvers for fully 3D two-phase flow models. As an initial step to improve the efficiency of solving space-time DG discretizations, we have developed, analyzed and tested optimized multigrid methods using explicit Runge-Kutta type smoothers for the 2D advection-diffusion equation. Many physical models describing fluid motion contain second (and higher) order derivatives. Obtaining a DG discretization for these higher order derivatives is non-trivial and many different DG methods exist to deal with these terms. As final topic of this thesis we introduce an alternative derivation of DG methods based on Borel measures. This alternative derivation gives a consistent treatment of derivative terms by assigning a measure to derivatives when the flow field is discontinuous. We investigate the various DG weak formulations arising from this technique by considering the 2D compressible Navier-Stokes equations for the viscous flows over a cylinder and a NACA0012 airfoil.},

  abstract = {Summary Riverbank erosion on the Red River in Winnipeg, Manitoba has raised concerns over the last 20years and more. Although several recent studies have shown that fluvial erosion can reduce riverbank stability and promote geotechnical slope failure, there are too few that have focused on this phenomenon. The present study includes field measurements, experimental testing, and numerical modelling to quantify fluvial erosion through a 10km reach of the Red River. Results have shown that seasonal freeze–thaw processes can dramatically reduce the critical shear stress and increase erodibility of the riverbanks. Moreover, a simple method has been employed using hydrodynamic numerical models to define the applied shear stresses on the river banks based on the river water level, which will be useful for further research and design purposes. The TEMP/W numerical model was used to define seasonal frost depth to estimate freeze–thaw effects. Finally all field measurements, experimental and numerical models results were used to predict annual fluvial erosion through this reach of the river.},

The mixed interaction of the river — the sea have formed fertile alluvial soil, with very diverse ecosystems. During more than 300 years of exploitation, we have never had to deal with the fierce impacts of weather, climate change, along with changes from upstream leading to erosion in both estuarines and coastal areas. In recent years, there have been many tropical depressions in the area, storms create strong waves phenomena, storm surges, and changes in the upstream areas, leading to the risk of erosion tends to increase. A numerical modelling and simulation experiment is carried out to assess the impact of anthropogenic such as discharge, sediment load and natural factors such as wave, tide, sea level rise due to climate change or storms to bank erosion on estuaries and coastlines. Erosion and deposition modelling was carried out in the study area under different scenarios, pay attention to storm surges, flowrate in the estuary. The modelling results are controlled and compared with reality, allowing the evaluation of the reliability of the modelling and serving to improve the design quality of the estuarine and coastal areas protection construction.},

Recent decades have witnessed exponential growth in the volume of new scientific and technological knowledge, thereby creating conditions that should be ripe for major advances8,9. Yet contrary to this view, studies suggest that progress is slowing in several major fields10,11. Here, we analyse these claims at scale across six decades, using data on 45 million papers and 3.9 million patents from six large-scale datasets, together with a new quantitative metric--the CD index12--that characterizes how papers and patents change networks of citations in science and technology. We find that papers and patents are increasingly less likely to break with the past in ways that push science and technology in new directions. This pattern holds universally across fields and is robust across multiple different citation- and text-based metrics1,13-17. Subsequently, we link this decline in disruptiveness to a narrowing in the use of previous knowledge, allowing us to reconcile the patterns we observe with the ‘shoulders of giants’ view. We find that the observed declines are unlikely to be driven by changes in the quality of published science, citation practices or field-specific factors. Overall, our results suggest that slowing rates of disruption may reflect a fundamental shift in the nature of science and technology.},

ABSTRACT = {Bedform-related roughness affects both water movement and sediment transport, so it is important that it is represented correctly in numerical morphodynamic models. The main objective of the present study is to quantify for the first time the importance of ripple- and megaripple-related roughness for modelled hydrodynamics and sediment transport on the wave- and tide-dominated Ameland ebb-tidal delta in the north of the Netherlands. To do so, a sensitivity analysis was performed, in which several types of bedform-related roughness predictors were evaluated using a Delft3D model. Also, modelled ripple roughness was compared to data of ripple heights observed in a six-week field campaign on the Ameland ebb-tidal delta. The present study improves our understanding of how choices in model set-up influence model results. By comparing the results of the model scenarios, it was found that the ripple and megaripple-related roughness affect the depth-averaged current velocity, mainly over the shallow areas of the delta. The small-scale ripples are also important for the suspended load sediment transport, both indirectly through the affected flow and directly. While the current magnitude changes by 10&ndash;20% through changes in bedform roughness, the sediment transport magnitude changes by more than 100%.},

  abstract = {Attention is given to the properties of sediment beds over the full range of conditions (silts to gravel), in particular the effect of fine silt on the bed composition and on initiation of motion (critical conditions) is discussed. High-quality bed-load transport data sets are identified and analyzed, showing that the bed-load transport in the sand range is related to velocity to power 2.5. The bed-load transport is not much affected by particle size. The prediction of bed roughness is addressed and the prediction of bed-load transport in steady river flow is extended to coastal flow applying an intrawave approach. Simplified bed-load transport formulas are presented, which can be used to obtain a quick estimate of bed-load transport in river and coastal flows. It is shown that the sediment transport of fine silts to coarse sand can be described in a unified model framework using fairly simple expressions. The proposed model is fully predictive in the sense that only the basic hydrodynamic parameters (depth, current velocity, wave height, wave period, etc.) and the basic sediment characteristics (d10, d50, d90, water temperature, and salinity) need to be known. The prediction of the effective bed roughness is an integral part of the model.},

  abstract     = {The transport process of fine sands in combined current and wave conditions in a flume was studied. Two types of sediment material were used, a very fine sand with a median diameter of about 100 μm and a medium‐fine sand with a diameter of 200 μm. The current velocities were varied in the range of 0.1– 0.5 m/s (following and opposing the waves). Irregular waves with a single‐topped spectrum and peak period of 2.5 s were generated. The significant wave height varied in the range of 0.075 m to 0.18 m. The water depth was about 0.5 m in all tests. Time‐averaged fluid velocities were measured by an electromagnetic current meter. Time‐averaged sediment concentrations were measured by a pump sampler. The transport rate was obtained by integration of the product of velocity and concentration over the depth. The generation of waves in following or opposing currents causes a decrease of the time‐averaged velocities in the near‐bed region. A larger wave height results in larger concentrations and in a more uniform distribution over the depth. The influence of the current direction on the concentration profile and the transport rate is negligible.},

  school =   {University of Glasgow},
  year =     {1981},
  abstract = {Historically the inter-flood period has been disregarded from investigations as it was deemed that the stability of non cohesive beds could only be altered by above threshold flows capable of sediment transport. However, this is at odds with more recent ‘stress history’ data which provides unequivocal evidence that entrainment thresholds can be delayed to higher shear stresses after being subjected to longer periods of sub threshold flows. The magnitude of this effect appears related to the surface grain size distribution and relative grain size effects, whilst the specific mechanics associated to generating a more resistant bed under sub-threshold flows are merely speculated upon. The aim of the present thesis is therefore to provide a comprehensive and quantitative data set on stress history that specifically address comparative grade effects and provides a detailed mechanistic understanding of the processes responsible for generating a more resistant bed configuration under sub threshold flows. Using a range of grain size distributions, a series of flume based experiments assess two main aspects of the stress history process. Firstly the effects of grain size distribution on the relationship between stress history duration and entrainment threshold is quantified. This is split into two sets of experiments based on the duration of the applied sub threshold antecedent flow, prescribed as 50% of the critical shear stress ( ) of the median grain size (D50). The antecedent durations of first set of experiment ranged from 0 to 60 minutes, whilst the antecedent duration of the second set of experiments ranged from 0 to 960 minutes. To ascertain the effect of the antecedent period on critical entrainment threshold and transported bedload, each experiment is concluded with a stability test composed of incrementally increased flow discharges until critical threshold conditions were reached. Secondly, aspect of stress history investigated uses high resolution laser scanning to assess bed topography and particle repositioning in order to ascertain the granular mechanics underpinning the stability process. The bed is scanned before and after the application of the applied antecedent flow with changes to bed surface structure described using Digital Elevation Models (DEM’s), statistical analysis and 1D and 2D semi-variograms to analyse scaling behaviour. In all experiments, increasing the antecedent flow duration significantly increases river bed stability in that the critical shear stress increases by up to 25% where uniform beds are more responsive to antecedency than bimodal beds. Laser based analysis reveals that vertical settlement, localised changes to bed roughness, pockets of more pronounced development of hiding effects, and particle repositioning are all mechanisms by which the bed reorganises under an applied sub threshold flow. However, the different bed grain size distributions cause significant differences in the importance of each mechanism in determining the magnitude of stress history induced bed stability.},

  abstract = {Abstract A continuous record reveals that the incidence of bedload in a coarse-grained river channel changes from flood to flood. Long periods of inactivity encourage the channel bed to consolidate sufficiently so that bedload is largely confined to the recession limb of the next flood-wave. But when floods follow each other closely, the bed material is comparatively loose and offers less resistance to entrainment. In this case, substantial amounts of bedload are generated on the rising limb. This is confirmed by values of bed shear stress or stream power at the threshold of initial motion which can be up to five times the overall mean in the case of isolated floods or those which are the first of the season. This produces a complicated relationship between flow parameters and bedload and explains some of the difficulties in establishing bedload rating curves for coarse-grained channels. Besides this, the threshold of initial motion is shown to occur at levels of bed shear stress three times those at the thresholds of final motion. This adds further confusion to attempts at developing predictive bedload equations and clearly indicates at least one reason why equations currently in use are unsatisfactory. Bedload is shown to be characterized by a series of pulses with a mean periodicity of 1.7 hours. In the absence of migrating bedforms, it is speculated that this well-documented pattern reflects the passage of kinematic waves of particles in a slow-moving traction carpet. The general pattern of bedload, including pulsations, is shown to occur more or less synchronously at different points across the stream channel.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Limited field and flume data suggests that both uniform and graded beds appear to progressively stabilize when subjected to inter-flood flows as characterized by the absence of active bedload transport. Previous work has shown that the degree of bed stabilization scales with duration of inter-flood flow, however, the sensitivity of this response to bed surface grain size distribution has not been explored. This article presents the first detailed comparison of the dependence of graded bed stability on inter-flood flow duration. Sixty discrete experiments, including repetitions, were undertaken using three grain size distributions of identical D50 (4.8 mm); near-uniform (σg = 1.13), unimodal (σg = 1.63) and bimodal (σg = 2.08). Each bed was conditioned for between 0 (benchmark) and 960 minutes by an antecedent shear stress below the entrainment threshold of the bed (τ*c50). The degree of bed stabilization was determined by measuring changes to critical entrainment thresholds and bedload flux characteristics. Results show that (i) increasing inter-flood duration from 0 to 960 minutes increases the average threshold shear stress of the D50 by up to 18\%; (ii) bedload transport rates were reduced by up to 90\% as inter-flood duration increased from 0 to 960 minutes; (iii) the rate of response to changes in inter-flood duration in both critical shear stress and bedload transport rate is non-linear and is inversely proportional to antecedent duration; (iv) there is a grade dependent response to changes in critical shear stress where the magnitude of response in uniform beds is up to twice that of the graded beds; and (v) there is a grade dependent response to changes in bedload transport rate where the bimodal bed is most responsive in terms of the magnitude of change. These advances underpin the development of more accurate predictions of both entrainment thresholds and bedload flux timing and magnitude, as well as having implications for the management of environmental flow design. © 2019 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd. © 2019 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract     = {The development of reliable, sophisticated hydro-morphodynamic models is essential for protecting the coastal environment against hazards such as flooding and erosion. There exists a high degree of uncertainty associated with the application of these models, in part due to incomplete knowledge of various physical, empirical and numerical closure related parameters in both the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic solvers. This uncertainty can be addressed through the application of adjoint methods. These have the notable advantage that the number and/or dimension of the uncertain parameters has almost no effect on the computational cost associated with calculating the model sensitivities. Here, we develop the first freely available and fully flexible adjoint hydro-morphodynamic model framework. This flexibility is achieved through using the pyadjoint library, which allows us to assess the uncertainty of any parameter with respect to any model functional, without further code implementation. The model is developed within the coastal ocean model Thetis constructed using the finite element code-generation library Firedrake. We present examples of how this framework can perform sensitivity analysis, inversion and calibration for a range of uncertain parameters based on the final bedlevel. These results are verified using so-called dual-twin experiments, where the ‘correct’ parameter value is used in the generation of synthetic model test data, but is unknown to the model in subsequent testing. Moreover, we show that inversion and calibration with experimental data using our framework produces physically sensible optimum parameters and that these parameters always lead to more accurate results. In particular, we demonstrate how our adjoint framework can be applied to a tsunami-like event to invert for the tsunami wave from sediment deposits.},

There is a need for predictive models for the natural response of river floodplains to hydraulic measures and river rehabilitation, such as river widening, construction of secondary channels and floodplain lowering. This thesis investigates floodplain biogeomorphology from a modeller's perspective. It addresses management concepts such as room-for-the-river and cyclic floodplain rejuvenation, in which a symbiosis is sought for between flood management and nature rehabilitation, and it shows how 1-D, 2-D and 3-D numerical models can be used to support them. Its main focus is on one of the knowledge gaps emerging from these model applications, viz. the effect of floodplain vegetation on the bed shear stress and subsequent bedload sediment transport. By means of a combination of theory development, flume experiments and field work, this research has resulted into a number of practically applicable and validated formulations for the hydraulic resistance and bed shear stress reduction of vegetation. These can be applied in large-scale numerical morphodynamic models to better design river measures in combination with nature rehabilitation.},

ABSTRACT = {Proper estimation of sediment movement is very critical for the management of alluvial rivers. Computing the sediment transport with single particle size is possible. However, particles on the river bed and in transport have a size distribution. It is very important to estimate bed material size change, such as bed armoring, in case of scour. In this study, the applicability of the bed sorting method, which is available with HEC-RAS, was analyzed. Bed sorting methods divide the bed into two or three layers. Numerical simulations were conducted in the Geum River, Korea. The performance of the simulation with respect to bed sorting methods was evaluated by considering the temporal change of bed material size during the scour and armoring process. Three layer methods are not applicable for a natural river and had oscillatory temporal bed material size variation. The two layer method has stable temporal bed material size changes and predicts the armoring of the bed properly even with limited field data. Consequently, the active layer method is reliable for natural rivers to simulate the bed material size change while applications of three layer methods require sufficient investigation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Meandering rivers display active communication between bank erosion and bar deposition processes. How does this occur? How does the river select its width? To answer these questions, we implement a model for meander migration where both bank processes (erosion and deposition) are considered independently. Bank erosion is modeled as erosion of purely noncohesive bank material damped by natural slump block armoring; channel deposition is modeled via flow-retarded vegetal encroachment. Both processes are tied to a slope-dependent channel forming Shields number; banks with near-bank Shields number below this value undergo deposition, and those above it undergo erosion. Channel-forming Shields number must increase with slope, as dictated by available data and model performance. Straight channel modeling shows that a channel arrives at an equilibrium width from any initial condition. For the channel bend, the river always approaches an asymptotic state where width reduces slowly in time and where bank erosion and deposition occur at nearly equal rates. Before this state is reached, however, the river follows a phase-plane trajectory with four possible regimes: (a) both banks erode, (b) both banks deposit, (c) both banks migrate outward, but with a faster depositing bank (bar push), and (d) both banks migrate outward, but with a faster eroding bank (bank pull). The trajectory of migration on the phase plane depends on initial conditions and input parameters controlling the rate of depositional and erosional migration. All input parameters have specific physical meaning, and the potential to be measured in the field.},

The sensitivity of a depth-averaged model to user-defined parameters (grain size, roughness, transverse bed slope effect, transport relations and secondary flow) is tested. According to the sensitivity analysis, grain size, transverse bed slope effect and sediment transport relations are critical to simulated meander bend morphodynamics. The parametrization of grain size has the most remarkable effect: field-based grain size parametrization is necessary in a successful morphodynamic reconstruction of a meander bend. The roughness parametrization method affects the distribution of flow velocities and therefore also morphodynamics. The combined effect of various parameters needs further research. Two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of a natural meander bend during a flood event are assessed against field measurements of acoustic Doppler current profiler and multi-temporal mobile laser scanning data. The depth-averaged velocities are simulated satisfactorily (differences from acoustic Doppler current profiler velocities 5–14\%) in both 2D and 3D simulations, but the advantage of the 3D hydrodynamic model is unquestionable because of its ability to model vertical and near-bed flows. The measured and modelled near-bed flow, however, differed notably from each other's, the reason of which was left open for future research. It was challenging to model flow direction beyond the apex. The 3D flow features, which also affected the distribution of the bed shear stress, seem not to have much effect on the predicted morphodynamics: the 2D and 3D morphodynamic reconstructions over the point bar resembled each other closely. Although common features between the modelled and measured morphological changes were also found, some specific changes that occurred were not evident in the simulation results. Our results show that short-term, sub-bend scale morphodynamic processes of a natural meander bend are challenging to model, which implies that they are affected by factors that have been neglected in the simulations. The modelling of short-term morphodynamics in natural curved channel is a challenge that requires further study. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

These features were in accordance with the observations for laboratory experiments. It also reproduced the features of braided rivers, such as the generation of new channels and abandonment of old channels, the bifurcation and confluence of channels, and the lateral migration of the channels. The model showed that the sediment discharge rate fluctuated with time, one of the dynamic features observed in braided channels.},

  abstract     = {Abstract The inception of channel meandering is the result of the complex interaction between flow, bed sediment, and bank material. A depth-averaged two-dimensional hydrodynamic model is developed to simulate the inception and development of channel meandering processes. The sediment transport model calculates both bedload and suspended load assuming equilibrium sediment transport. Bank erosion consists of two interactive processes: basal erosion and bank failure. Basal erosion is calculated from a newly derived equation for the entrainment of sediment particles by hydrodynamic forces. The mass conservation equation, where basal erosion and bank failure are considered source terms, was solved to obtain the rate of bank erosion. The parallel bank failure model was tested with the laboratory experiments of Friedkin on the initiation and evolution processes of non-cohesive meandering channels. The model replicates the downstream translation and lateral extension of meandering loops reasonably well. Plots of meandering planforms illustrate the evolution of sand bars and redistribution of flow momentum in meandering channels. This numerical modelling study demonstrates the potential of depth-integrated two-dimensional models for the simulation of meandering processes. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The three-dimensional CFD model computed water flow and sediment transport in alluvial channels and predicted vertical and horizontal bed changes. Different algorithms and parameters were tested to provide an insight into the application range of CFD when modelling free-forming meander formation. The computational domain was discretized by an unstructured grid. A control volume method was used for the discretization of the Navier–Stokes equations for the flow calculation and of the convection–diffusion equation for the sediment transport calculation. Turbulence was modelled by the k–ε turbulence model. The simulation was started from an initially straight grid, with neither sediment feed nor any perturbation at the inflow boundary. The model computed the river bed evolution over a real time period of 3 d. Results were compared with laboratory experiments and showed that the CFD model can predict many of the characteristics of the alluvial meander formation and migration. However, some limitations and uncertainties exist that have to be clarified in future investigations.},

A simplified, axisymmetrical model of water flow, sediment transport, bank erosion and bank advance is used to study the first two mechanisms. Simulations using the model are compared with field data from a bank stabilization project along the Brahmaputra-Jamuna River in Bangladesh. The effects of bank stabilization are reproduced qualitatively but the quantitative results are poor. The model overestimates channel width while underestimating bank migration rate and outer-bend scour.},

Second, it simulates the deposition of failed bank material debris at and its subsequent removal from the toe of the bank. Finally, the governing conservation equations are implemented in a moving boundary fitted coordinate system that can be both curvilinear and nonorthogonal. This simplifies grid generation in curved channels that experience bank deformation, allowing complex planform shapes associated with irregular natural channels to be simulated. Model performance is assessed using data from two flume experiments and a natural river channel. Results are encouraging, but the model underpredicts the scour depth in pools adjacent to the outer bank and, consequently, underpredicts bank migration rates.},

This paper contains a comprehensive Fourier stability analysis of the Preissmann scheme applied to the St. Venant equations, including the general form of the friction term. Previous analyses have either neglected or simplified the form of the flow resistance. No such approximations are made in this paper. It shows analytically that the linearized, numerical equations are stable when weighted towards the new time level and when the magnitude of the Vedernikov number is less than one. This second condition is the limit of hydrodynamic stability at which roll waves form and the numerical scheme mirrors this physical stability limit. Difficulties that occur in practical applications of this computational method must have their origin in factors omitted from the Fourier analysis, such as the treatment of boundary conditions and the nonlinear terms in the flow equations.},

  abstract     = {A frequent problem with process-based coastal morphological models is the appearance of high wave number spatial oscillations in the simulated bed levels with time. After a sufficiently long time, these oscillations become dominant and mask the large-scale features of the bed level evolution. The equation for conservation of sediment mass is used to show that the spatial oscillations are generated by the dependence of the bed celerity (celerity of the bed level oscillations) with bed levels, which is due to the non-linear relationship between sediment transport and bed levels. This breeds higher spatial harmonics of the bed level oscillations with time. In this situation, using a Finite Difference (FD) scheme that does not damp oscillations with high wave numbers leads to the generated harmonics being kept in the solution. These generate further harmonics until the entire solution is dominated by high wave number oscillations. In this paper, a finite difference scheme, in combination with a filtering procedure, is used to dissipate high wave number oscillations. Analysis of the amplification portraits show that the filtering procedure in combination with a Lax–Wendroff scheme does not affect oscillations with lower wave numbers (larger scale features resolved with seven or more grid points). Some examples are also presented to illustrate these features.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the development and application of a physics-based morphological model for simulating the evolution processes of braided channels. This model comprises a depth-integrated hydrodynamic sub-model for rapidly varying unsteady flows and a bed load sediment transport sub-model for non-uniform sediments. The sheltering effects of non-uniform particles and the lateral sediment transport due to bed slope and secondary flow are taken into account in the sediment sub-model. Channel bed level change is calculated according to the erosion/deposition rate, and the bank movement is modelled according to the submerged angle of repose, which is valid for braided rivers in natural and experimental conditions. The model has been applied to a braided river produced in a flume experiment, and the numerical model-predicted channel patterns are shown to generally well resemble the experimental river. Most of the morphodynamic processes observed in the experiment can be found in the numerical predictions, including the evolution of the channel from a single straight channel to a multi-thread pattern and local morphologic changes. The mechanisms of the morphodynamic evolution of multi-thread flows are investigated, in which the process of grain sorting occurs under the interaction of fluid and sand, and the effect on channel migration is identified.},

  abstract     = {Incision and ensuing widening of alluvial stream channels is widespread in the midsouth and midwestern United States and represents an important form of channel adjustment. Streambanks have been found to contribute as much as 80\% of the total suspended load. The location, timing, and magnitude of streambank erosion are difficult to predict. Results from field studies to characterize the resistance of fine-grained materials to hydraulic and geotechnical erosion, the impact of pore-water pressures on failure dimensions and shearing resistance, and the role of riparian vegetation on matric suction, streambank permeability, and shearing resistance are used to enhance the channel evolution model CONCEPTS (conservational channel evolution and pollutant transport system). This paper discusses the conceptualization of the above-mentioned physical processes, and demonstrates the ability of the derived model to simulate streambank-failure processes. The model is tested against observed streambank erosion of a bendway on Goodwin Creek, Miss. between March 1996 and March 2001, where it accurately predicts the rate of retreat of the outside bank of the bendway. The observed change in average channel width within the central section of the bendway is  2.96 m  over the simulation period, whereas a retreat of  3.18 m  (7.4\% larger) is simulated. The observed top-bank retreat within the central section of the bendway is  3.54 m  over the simulation period, whereas a retreat of  3.01 m  (15\% smaller) is simulated.},

The numerical schemes mentioned above are employed in Gerris which is open source free software and provides a shallow water solver on adaptive quadtree grids.

Simulations are carried out with a parallelized immersed-boundary flow solver that allows us to simulate this flow on a stationary Cartesian grid. The ventricular flow behavior is analyzed to reveal blood flow patterns during both filling and ejection for normal ventricles, as well as ventricles with diastolic and systolic dysfunctions. Impaired relaxation associated with early-stage diastolic dysfunction is modeled by a reduced E/A ratio, and the systolic dysfunction addressed here is obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HOCM), where the thickened ventricular septum in the basal region obstructs the outflow tract. Simulations are also performed to study the effect of septal myectomy on the ventricular flow. We examine the characteristic features of these various conditions including vortex dynamics, ‘virtual’ color M-mode cardiography as well as mixing and transport of blood through the left-ventricle during the entire cardiac cycle.},

The numerical model solves the two-dimensional non-linear shallow water equations by means of an explicit second-order MUSCL-Hancock Godunov-type finite volume scheme. Interface fluxes are evaluated using an HLLC approximate Riemann solver. Cartesian cut cells are used to improve the fit to curved boundaries. A ghost-cell immersed boundary method is used to update flow information in the smallest cut cells and overcome the time step restriction that would otherwise apply. The numerical model is validated through simulations of reflection of a surge wave at a wall, a low Froude number potential flow past a circular cylinder, and the shock-like interaction between a bore and a circular cylinder. The computational efficiency is shown to be greatly improved compared with solutions on a uniform structured grid implemented with cut cells. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Eulerian mesh computations of simple linear and nonlinear one-dimensional wave propagations with second and higher order convective difference schemes exhibit nonphysical oscillations near steep gradient regions of the solution. This computational noise may propagate a significant number of mesh intervals away from the regions in which it is generated and severely compromise the solution accuracy. Boris, Book, and van Leer have developed nonlinear filtering techniques for second order convection algorithms which effectively remove computational noise from steep gradient solutions. The principal disadvantage of these filtering techniques is that solutions of sharply peaked waves are penalized in amplitude accuracy of the extrema. A nonlinear method of filtering computational noise from fourth and higher order accurate convective difference schemes is introduced which removes the computational noise without inflicting significant amplitude losses in sharply peaked waves. One-dimensional simple linear and nonlinear test problems are used to illustrate the performance of various unfiltered and filtered convective difference schemes. It is noted that the filtered higher order convective difference schemes require less than one-third of the mesh points of the filtered second order convective difference schemes to model the extrema of sharply peaked waves to the same accuracy. Finally, the Accurate Space Derivative method of Gazdag is shown to function with the global numerical differentiation performed with compact polynomial splines. This method is at least sixth and tenth order accurate, respectively, for modeling linear waves with cubic and quintic spline differentation for Courant numbers less than about 14.},

  abstract     = {The basic idea of subgrid models is the use of available high-resolution bathymetric data at subgrid level in computations that are performed on relatively coarse grids allowing large time steps. For that purpose, an algorithm that correctly represents the precise mass balance in regions where wetting and drying occur was derived by Casulli (Int J Numer Method Fluids 60:391-408, 2009) and Casulli and Stelling (Int J Numer Method Fluids 67:441-449, 2010). Computational grid cells are permitted to be wet, partially wet, or dry, and no drying threshold is needed. Based on the subgrid technique, practical applications involving various scenarios were implemented including an operational forecast model for water level, salinity, and temperature of the Elbe Estuary in Germany. The grid generation procedure allows a detailed boundary fitting at subgrid level. The computational grid is made of flow-aligned quadrilaterals including few triangles where necessary. User-defined grid subdivision at subgrid level allows a correct representation of the volume up to measurement accuracy. Bottom friction requires a particular treatment. Based on the conveyance approach, an appropriate empirical correction was worked out. The aforementioned features make the subgrid technique very efficient, robust, and accurate. Comparison of predicted water levels with the comparatively highly resolved classical unstructured grid model shows very good agreement. The speedup in computational performance due to the use of the subgrid technique is about a factor of 20. A typical daily forecast can be carried out in less than 10 min on a standard PC-like hardware. The subgrid technique is therefore a promising framework to perform accurate temporal and spatial large-scale simulations of coastal and estuarine flow and transport processes at low computational cost.},

  abstract  = {The level set method for capturing moving fronts was introduced in 1987 by Osher and Sethian [401]. It has proven to be phenomenally successful as a numerical device. For example, as of June 2002, typing in ``Level Set Methods'' on Google's search engine gives roughly 2800 responses and the original article has been cited over 530 times (according to web of science). Applications range from capturing multiphase fluid dynamical flows, to graphics, e.g. special effects in Hollywood, to visualization, image processing, control, epitaxial growth, computer vision and include many others. In this chapter we shall give an overview of the numerical technology and of applications in imaging science. These will include surface interpolation, solving PDE's on manifolds, visibility, ray tracing, segmentation (including texture segmentation) and restoration.},

  abstract     = {The level set method was devised by S. Osher and J. A. Sethian (1988, J. Comput. Phys.79, 12–49) as a simple and versatile method for computing and analyzing the motion of an interface Γ in two or three dimensions. Γ bounds a (possibly multiply connected) region Ω. The goal is to compute and analyze the subsequent motion of Γ under a velocity field v. This velocity can depend on position, time, the geometry of the interface, and the external physics. The interface is captured for later time as the zero level set of a smooth (at least Lipschitz continuous) function ϕ (x, t); i.e., Γ(t)={x|ϕ(x, t)=0}. ϕ is positive inside Ω, negative outside Ω, and is zero on Γ(t). Topological merging and breaking are well defined and easily performed. In this review article we discuss recent variants and extensions, including the motion of curves in three dimensions, the dynamic surface extension method, fast methods for steady state problems, diffusion generated motion, and the variational level set approach. We also give a user's guide to the level set dictionary and technology and couple the method to a wide variety of problems involving external physics, such as compressible and incompressible (possibly reacting) flow, Stefan problems, kinetic crystal growth, epitaxial growth of thin films, vortex-dominated flows, and extensions to multiphase motion. We conclude with a discussion of applications to computer vision and image processing.},

The speed may be an arbitrary function of curvature, and the front also can be passively advected by an underlying flow. These algorithms approximate the equations of motion, which resemble Hamilton-Jacobi equations with parabolic right-hand sides, by using techniques from hyperbolic conservation laws. Non-oscillatory schemes of various orders of accuracy are used to solve the equations, providing methods that accurately capture the formation of sharp gradients and cusps in the moving fronts. The algorithms handle topological merging and breaking naturally, work in any number of space dimensions, and do not require that the moving surface be written as a function. The methods can be also used for more general Hamilton-Jacobi-type problems. We demonstrate our algorithms by computing the solution to a variety of surface motion problems.},

Phys.79, 12) and address two important issues that are intrinsic to the level set method: (a) how to extend a quantity that is given only on the interface to a neighborhood of the interface; (b) how to reset the level set function to be a signed distance function to the interface efficiently without appreciably moving the interface. This fast local level set method reduces the computational effort by one order of magnitude, works in as much generality as the original one, and is conceptually simple and easy to implement. Our approach differs from previous related works in that we extract all the information needed from the level set function (or functions in multiphase flow) and do not need to find explicitly the location of the interface in the space domain. The complexity of our method to do tasks such as extension and distance reinitialization is O(N), where N is the number of points in space, not O(N log N) as in works by Sethian (1996, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 93, 1591) and Helmsen and co-workers (1996, SPIE Microlithography IX, p. 253). This complexity estimation is also valid for quite general geometrically based front motion for our localized method.},

In their 1983 paper, Harten, Lax, and van Leer showed how, with a priori knowledge of the signal velocities, a single-state approximate Riemann solver could be constructed so as to automatically satisfy the entropy condition and yield exact resolution of isolated shock waves. Harten, Lax, and van Leer further showed that a two-state approximation could be devised, such that both shock and contact waves would be resolved exactly. However, the full implementation of this two-state approximation was never given. We show that with an appropriate choice of acoustic and contact wave velocities, the two-state so-called HLLC construction of Toro, Spruce, and Speares will yield this exact resolution of isolated shock and contact waves. We further demonstrate that the resulting scheme is positively conservative. This property, which cannot be guaranteed by any linearized approximate Riemann solver, forces the numerical method to preserve initially positive pressures and densities. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate that the solutions generated are comparable to those produced with an exact Riemann solver, only with a stronger enforcement of the entropy condition across expansion waves.},

Heuristic arguments are presented to support our choice of bounds. We derive first-order schemes which use these approximate Riemann solutions and show their relationship to known finite difference schemes.Next, we use the approach of van Leer et al. [1] to construct second-order schemes based on these approximate Riemann solutions. Of particular interest is a central difference scheme requiring no upwind switches. This scheme is only slightly more complex than standard predictor–corrector finite difference schemes. Preliminary numerical results are presented which show that these schemes are nonoscillatory, have good shock resolution and produce results which are competitive with those produced by more complex second order Godunov-type schemes.},

The results show that the observed water levels display a linearly decreasing trend attributed to channel bed erosion. A deviation from this trend, which would be an indication of the effect of human intervention, was not observed. We propose that the most likely explanation for this is that any effect observable at lower discharge is hidden in the uncertainty of the rating curve. Given the inherent uncertainties associated with making predictions about a changing system for conditions with a low period of return, we argue that model uncertainty should be considered in intervention design.},

This becomes evident from a series of computational tests performed in order to compare two different methods of error reduction in the computed local channel curvature: cubic spline interpolations versus different levels of curvature smoothing. Since the problems discussed are common to most meander migration models, the tests performed were carried out for three models of different complexity. These were derived by applying different degrees of simplification to the basic equations for water flow and sediment motion of shallow curved channels.},

The approach combines a recently developed semi-implicit subgrid method with a hierarchical grid solution strategy. The method allows the incorporation of high-resolution data on subgrid scale to obtain a more accurate and efficient hydrodynamic model. The subgrid method improves the efficiency of the hierarchical grid method by providing better solutions on coarse grids. The method is applicable to both steady and unsteady flows, but we particularly focus on river flows with steady boundary conditions. There, the combined hierarchical grid–subgrid method reduces the computational effort to obtain a steady state with factors up to 43. For unsteady models, the method can be used for efficiently generating accurate initial conditions on high-resolution grids. Additionally, the method provides automatic insight in grid convergence. We demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of the method using a schematic test for the vortex shedding around a circular cylinder and a real-world river case study.

  abstract     = {Abstract The stability of a river bank depends on the balance of forces, motive and resistive, associated with the most critical mechanism of failure. Many mechanisms are possible and the likelihood of failure occurring by any particular one depends on the size, geometry and structure of the bank, the engineering properties of the bank material, the hydraulics of flow in the adjacent channel and climatic conditions. Rivers flowing through alluvial deposits often have a composite structure of cohesionless sand and gravel overlain by cohesive silt/clay. Bank erosion occurs by fluvial entrainment of material from the lower, cohesionless bank at a much higher rate than material from the upper, cohesive bank. This leads to undermining that produces cantilevers of cohesive material. Upper bank retreat takes place predominantly by the failure of these cantilevers. Three mechanisms of failure have been identified: shear, beam and tensile failure. The stability of a cantilever may be analysed using static equilibrium and beam theory, and dimensionless charts for cantilever stability constructed. Application of the charts requires only a few simple measurements of cantilever geometry and soil properties. In this analysis the effects of cracks and fissures in the soil must be taken into account. These cracks seriously weaken the soil and can invalidate a stability analysis by affecting the shape of the failure surface. Following mechanical failure, blocks of soil must be removed from the basal area by fluvial entrainment if rapid undermining and cantilever generation are to continue. Hence, the rate of bank retreat is fluvially controlled, even though the mechanism of failure of the upper bank is not directly fluvial in nature. This cycle of bank erosion: undermining, cantilever failure and fluvial scour of the toe, operates over several flood events and has important implications for river engineering, channel changes, and the movement of sediment through fluvial systems.},

These parameters define the bank geometry following failure and form the starting point for subsequent analyses. The calculation procedure is illustrated by a worked example. Following mass failure slump, debris accumulates at the bank toe. The debris is removed by lateral erosion prior to further oversteepening or degradation generating further mass failures. Any process‐based model for channel width adjustment must account for the combined effects of lateral erosion and mass instability in producing bank instability. The approach adopted here represents a marked improvement over earlier work, which does not account for changes in bank geometry due to lateral erosion prior to mass failure.

A new analysis of bank erosion and failure is developed, using a critical shear‐stress concept to account for lateral erosion and a slope stability criterion for mass failure. In this paper, we apply the analysis to two problems of bank retreat often encountered by practicing engineers dealing with alluvial channels. The first application is to the prediction of degradation downstream of a dam for the case in which bed lowering causes bank instability. We show that rapid bank retreat can occur once the threshold height for mass failure of the banks is reached. This supplies sediment to the flow, tends to limit the depth of degradation, and drives complex response downstream. The second application is to the modeling of flow in channel bends and the prediction of the equilibrium cross section. We show that scour depth at the outer bank may be limited by the critical bank height. If scouring causes the outer bank to fail, then the channel will migrate laterally rather than scour down vertically. The analysis presented here can be used to predict the equilibrium cross section and migration rate incorporating bank stability considerations. It could also be used to predict the likely increase in scour depth resulting from outer bank stabilization in a bendway.},

  abstract     = {Many existing morphological models are limited by their inability to account for changing channel width through time. In this and a companion paper, the development and testing of a numerical model of river widening are reported. The new model is applicable to straight, sand-bed streams with cohesive bank materials, and nonuniform bathymetry and width in the longitudinal direction. The flow field is obtained by solving versions of the flow resistance, flow momentum, and continuity equations, which account for the influence of gradually varied flow and lateral shear in the near bank zones. Secondary and overbank flows are excluded. Predicted flows are used to account for streamwise and transverse sediment transport fluxes. Numerical solution of the sediment continuity equation allows temporal variations in bed-material size, bed morphology, and bank geometry to be simulated. Channel widening is simulated by coupling bank stability with flow and sediment transport algorithms. A probabilistic approach is used to estimate the longitudinal extent of mass failures within modeled reaches, and mixed layer theory is used to model the transport of the resulting bed and bank material mixture. Assessment of the accuracy of the new model, discussed in the companion paper, indicates that the new model simulations of widths, depths, and deepening rates are within 15\% of observed values, but widening rates are underpredicted by a factor of approximately 3.},

First, predictions of evolution of a 13.5 km reach of the South Fork of the Forked Deer River, in west Tennessee, were compared to observations over a 24-yr period. Results suggest that although the model was able to qualitatively predict trends of widening and deepening, quantitative predictions were not reliable. Simulated widths and depths were within 15\% of the corresponding observed values, but observed change in these parameters at the study sites were also close to these values. Simulated rates of depth adjustment were within 15\% of observed rates, but observed rates of channel widening at the study sites were approximately three times those simulated by the model. In the second approach, the model was used to generate relationships between stable channel width and bank-full discharge. The model was able to successfully replicate the form of empirically derived regime-width equations. Simulations were used to demonstrate the model's ability to obtain more realistic predictions of bed evolution in widening channels.},

  abstract     = {The erosion of sediment from riverbanks affects a range of physical and ecological issues. Bank retreat often involves combinations of fluvial erosion and mass wasting, and in recent years, bank retreat models have been developed that combine hydraulic erosion and limit equilibrium stability models. In related work, finite element seepage analyses have also been used to account for the influence of pore water pressure in controlling the onset of mass wasting. This paper builds on these previous studies by developing a simulation modeling approach in which the hydraulic erosion, finite element seepage, and limit equilibrium stability models are, for the first time, fully coupled. Application of the model is demonstrated by undertaking simulations of a single flow event at a single study site for scenarios where (1) there is no fluvial erosion and the bank geometry profile remains constant throughout, (2) there is no fluvial erosion but the bank profile is deformed by simulated mass wasting, and (3) the bank profile is allowed to freely deform in response to both simulated fluvial erosion and mass wasting. The results are limited in scope to the specific conditions encountered at the study site, but they nevertheless demonstrate the significant role that fluvial erosion plays in steepening the bank profile or creating overhangs, thereby triggering mass wasting. However, feedbacks between the various processes also lead to unexpected outcomes. Specifically, fluvial erosion also affects bank stability indirectly, as deformation of the bank profile alters the hydraulic gradients driving infiltration into the bank, thereby modulating the evolution of the pore water pressure field. Consequently, the frequency, magnitude, and mode of bank erosion events in the fully coupled scenario differ from the two scenarios in which not all the relevant bank process interactions are included.},

  abstract     = {Widening in sinuous channels occurs when the retreat of the outer bank exceeds the advance of the opposite bank. An analytical model is presented to simulate width adjustment in meandering channels of non-cohesive bank material resulting from bank erosion of two interactive processes: basal erosion and bank collapse. Bank collapse refers to the avalanche of non-cohesive material in the upper part of bank above water surface resulting from over-steepening of the bank surface due to basal erosion. The rate of basal erosion, including lateral erosion and bed degradation, is calculated as a function of the longitudinal gradient of sediment transport rate and strength of secondary flow. The transverse bed slope is treated as a variable that increases as channel sinuosity increases until the transverse bed slope reaches its maximum value. By simplifying the bank-collapse process for non-cohesive materials, the present study shows that the rate of bank-line retreat is determined by lateral erosion rate, near-bank bed-degradation rate, sediment grain size, and difference between flow depth and bank height. The time-dependent widening processes of two meandering channels in the laboratory are selected to test applicability of the model. The result shows that the simulated bank lines at individual time intervals closely match the experimental measurements. Whether the sinuosity of a meandering channel will increase or decrease is primarily determined by didtribution of the lngitudinal gradient of sediment transport rate along the channel.},

  abstract     = {Bank erosion consists of two processes: basal erosion due to fluvial hydraulic force and bank failure under the influence of gravity. Because bank resistance force varies with the degree of saturation of bank material, the probability of bank failure is the probability of the driving force of bank failure being greater than the bank resistance force. The degree of saturation of bank material increases with river stage; therefore, the frequency of bank failure is correlated to the frequency of flooding. Consequently, the rate of bank erosion is due to both basal erosion and bank failure, and bank failure is a probabilistic phenomenon. In this paper, for cohesive bank material experiencing planar bank failure, a deterministic approach was adopted for basal erosion analysis, whereas the probability of bank failure was included in the analysis of bank failure. A method for calculating the rate of bank erosion was derived that integrates both basal erosion and bank failure processes, and accounts for the effects of hydraulic force, bank geometry, bank material properties, and probability of bank failure.},

A generalized implicit Preissmann scheme is used for the spatial and temporal discretization of the flow governing equations to accommodate large time steps and cross sections spaced at irregular intervals. The solution method introduces several enhancements that increase its robustness, specifically to simulate flashy flows. Transport of cohesive or cohesionless graded bed material is based on a total-load concept, and suspended and bed load transport modes are accounted for through nonequilibrium effects.

The present paper focuses mainly on the treatment of streamflow hydraulics and evolution of graded streambeds, and reports simulations of published experiments on degrading and aggrading channels with graded bed material.

  abstract     = {Abstract Sustainable river management can be supported by models predicting long-term morphological developments. Even for one-dimensional morphological models, run times can be up to several days for simulations over multiple decades. Alternatively, analytical tools yield metrics that allow estimation of migration celerity and damping of bed waves, which have potential for being used as rapid assessment tools to explore future morphological developments. We evaluate the use of analytical relations based on linear stability analyses of the St. Venant-Exner equations, which apply to bed waves with spatial scales much larger than the water depth. With a one-dimensional numerical morphological model, we assess the validity range of the analytical approach. The comparison shows that the propagation of small bed perturbations is well-described by the analytical approach. For Froude numbers over 0.3, diffusion becomes important and bed perturbation celerities reduce in time. A spatial-mode linear stability analysis predicts an upper limit for the bed perturbation celerity. For longer and higher bed perturbations, the dimensions relative to the water depth and the backwater curve length determine whether the analytical approach yields realistic results. For higher bed wave amplitudes, non-linearity becomes important. For Froude numbers ≤0.3, the celerity of bed waves is increasingly underestimated by the analytical approach. The degree of underestimation is proportional to the ratio of bed wave amplitude to water depth and the Froude number. For Froude numbers exceeding 0.3, the net impact on the celerity depends on the balance between the decrease due to damping and the increase due to non-linear interaction.},

  abstract     = {Accurate discharge records are essential for flood frequency analyses, hydraulic model calibration and flood forecasting. Discharge records are often obtained via a transformation of water levels to discharges using a rating curve. For accurate rating curves, a physical basis is important, particularly in the extrapolation domain towards extreme discharges. In this study, physical processes and constraints are incorporated in a rating curve model: water balance closure at a bifurcation and bed level degradation. The aim is to assess the effect of incorporating these physical processes and constraints for rating curves at two bifurcations of the Rhine river in the Netherlands. Intermittent gaugings are available for a 31 year period at these bifurcations. Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling is used to estimate the posterior distributions of the rating curves. If rating curves are constructed independently, they show a large water balance error at bifurcations of up to 10%. Incorporating bed level degradation is required for accurate rating curves as it reduces the residual errors by up to 50%. If explicitly accounting for water balance closure, the water balance error can be reduced to 1%, while residual errors remain equally small. As water balance closure is a physical constraint at a river bifurcation, the rating curves that account for water balance closure are expected to be more physically realistic. Therefore, it is recommended to specifically gauge at river bifurcations and confluences, such that the constraint of water balance closure can be used to improve the accuracy of rating curves and discharge records.},

The results showed that the 95\% confidence interval of the design water levels is 0.49 m, 0.34 m and 0.12 m for bed form, vegetation classification and vegetation roughness parameterisation, respectively, and approximately 0.68 m for the combined roughness.

  abstract     = {Abstract Multithread fluvial environments like anastomosing and braided rivers are fundamentally directed by the continuous concatenation of channel bifurcations and confluences, which distribute flow and sediment among different branches that are reconnecting further downstream. A large number of theoretical, experimental, and numerical studies conducted in the last two decades have provided a clear picture of stability conditions for river bifurcations. However, most analyses are focused on the dynamics of bifurcations alone, ignoring the possible mutual interaction with downstream confluences. In this work, we study the morphodynamic equilibrium and stability conditions of a bifurcation-confluence loop, where flow splits in two secondary anabranches that rejoin after a prescribed distance. Through the formulation of a novel theoretical model for mobile bed confluences, we show that the dominating anabranch (i.e., that carrying most discharge) is subject to an increase of the water surface elevation that is proportional to the square of the Froude number. This effect causes a decrease of the slope of the dominating anabranch, which acts as a negative feedback that increases the stability of the bifurcation-confluence system. A linear analysis of the coupled model reveals that the stabilizing effect exerted by the confluence depends on the ratio between the length of the anabranches and the average water depth, independently of channel slope and Froude number. Ultimately, this effect is potentially able to stabilize the loop even when the sediment is mainly transported in suspension, a condition which makes the classic stabilizing mechanism (i.e., the topographic effect at the bifurcation node) practically ineffective.},

A large number of these methods were already developed and compared. However, on graphics processing units (GPUs), such comparisons are relatively scarce. In this paper, we present the results of comparing two time-integration methods for the shallow water equations on structured grids. An explicit and a semi-implicit time integration method were considered. For the semi-implicit method, the performance of several iterative solvers was compared. The implementation of the semi-implicit method on a GPU in this study was a novel approach for the shallow water equations. This also holds for the repeated red black (RRB) solver that was found to be very efficient on a GPU. Additionally, the results of both methods were compared with several CPU-based software systems for the shallow water flows on structured grids. On a GPU, the simulations were 25 to 75 times faster than on a CPU. Theory predicts an explicit method to be best suited for a GPU due to the higher level of inherent parallelism. It was found that both the explicit and the semi-implicit methods ran efficiently on a GPU. For very shallow applications, the explicit method was preferred because the stability condition on the time step was not very restrictive. However, for deep water applications, we expect the semi-implicit method to be preferred.},

  abstract     = {Predicting when riparian vegetation establishes on river bars is crucial to estimate how morphology and ecology of gravel bed rivers respond to anthropogenic or climatic changes. However, the characteristic timescale required for vegetation establishment on gravel bars remains poorly investigated. The Windows of Opportunity (WoO) concept provides an ideal framework for estimating such timescale by analyzing time series of disturbance periods following seed dispersal. Here we present the results of a study conducted in a 41 km long reach of the Alpine Rhine river characterized by the presence of alternate gravel bars, which show differences in morphological activity and vegetated areas. We mapped the time evolution of vegetation cover between 1996 and 2017 by using aerial images and related vegetation occurrence to bar topography. Observations show that vegetation mainly colonized bar surfaces between 2005 and 2008, enduring on bars that showed less morphological activity. Only few patches, which were removed by downstream bar migration, were observed on bars that experienced significant morphological changes. This allowed us to identify conditions that were more favorable to vegetation recruitment and growth. To explain the vegetation pattern observed along the whole reach, we developed a simple modeling framework based on the WoO concept including the effects of flow variability on seed dispersal and seedling recruitment and survival. Model applications demonstrate that vegetation successfully establishes on bare areas if plants can withstand hydrodynamic disturbances for about 85 days after seed dispersal. We also identified timing and location of successful recruitment events and discussed how they are linked to bar morphology, seed dispersal, and riverbed morphodynamics. This study provides a first attempt to quantify the WoO in a gravel bed river with alternate bars, representing a step toward the development of quantitative tools for predicting river morphological trajectories.},

The numerical model was based on the finite volume method using an unstructured grid with dominantly hexahedral cells. The k-ε model was used to predict turbulence and the SIMPLE method was used to compute the pressure. The sediment transport was computed as bed load in addition to solving the convection-diffusion equation for suspended sediment transport. The bed changes were calculated and the grid was altered during the computation as channel erosion and deposition caused wetting and drying. The model was tested by comparing with results from physical model studies carried out at Colorado State Univ., Fort Collins, Colo. The results showed successfully the replication of many of the meander characteristics, including secondary currents, cross-sectional profiles, meander planform, meander wavelength, downstream meander migration, and chute formation.},

        abstract = {In 1996 werd besloten dat de maatgevende hoogwaterafvoer in de Nederlandse rivieren verhoogd moest worden. De nieuwe maatgevende hoogwaterafvoer werd gebaseerd op de afvoer die theoretisch gezien eens in de 1250 jaar optreedt (kans van optreden van 1/1250 jaar). Uiteindelijk resulteerde dat in de maatgevende hoogwaterafvoer van 16.000 m3/s. Dat betekende dat de rivieren in Nederland die hoeveelheid water veilig moesten kunnen afvoeren. Op veel locaties in Nederland zou die afvoer echter problemen veroorzaken indien er geen maatregelen zouden plaatsvinden. De volgende stap volgde die gedachtegang. Er was duidelijk dat er iets moest gebeuren om de veiligheid te kunnen garanderen. In 2000 volgde daaruit het landelijke plan ?Ruimte voor de Rivier?. Dit is een plan dat bestaat uit maatregelen voor meer dan dertig locaties verspreid over Nederland. Deze maatregelen moesten ervoor zorgen dat er meer ruimte ontstond voor de rivieren om het water in tijden van hoogwater af te voeren. In de IJssel ter hoogte van Deventer werd dit gerealiseerd door een vergraving van de uiterwaarden. De uiterwaarden werden daar verlaagd waardoor de IJssel meer ruimte had om in te stromen. De doelstelling voor de Ruimte voor de Rivier plan was daarmee bereikt. Er bleek echter eveneens een negatief effect aan de maatregelen te hangen. De vergraving van de uiterwaarden zou ervoor zorgen dat er een ophoging van de rivierbodem plaats zou vinden. Met alle gevolgen van dien. E?n van die gevolgen was overlast voor scheepvaart doordat de IJssel, in Deventer, ondieper zou worden. Om dat tegen te gaan zijn de eilandkribben ontworpen en aangelegd in de IJssel. De eilandkribben zijn bedacht nadat de Rijkswaterstaat en prijsvraag had uitgeschreven met als onderwerp ?Kribben van de toekomst?. De winnaar van die prijsvraag was de eilandkrib. De eilandkribben waren nog nooit ergens getest. Om die reden was er nog niet bekend hoe en of de eilandkribben in de praktijk zouden werken. De pilot in Deventer is een goede mogelijkheid om een beeld te krijgen van de werking van de eilandkribben. In de tweede helft van 2015 zijn de eilandkribben daadwerkelijk gerealiseerd. Er zit nog een stap tussen de aanleg van de eilandkribben en het vaststellen of het verwerpen van de functionaliteit van de eilandkribben. Die stap is het opstellen van een plan voor het monitoren van de eilandkribben. Dat is in dit rapport uitgevoerd. De doelstelling die aan het begin van dit rapport is geformuleerd voor dit onderzoek betrof het vinden van een methode die beschikbaar en toepasbaar was voor zowel het technisch als sociaal monitoren van de eilandkribben in de IJssel bij Deventer. Met het technisch monitoren wordt hier bedoelt het monitoren van de doelstelling die zijn opgesteld voor de eilandkribben. Die doelstelling zijn gericht op de bodemdaling in de vaargeul van de IJssel en een toename van de flora en fauna die zou moeten ontstaan door de vorm van de eilandkribben. Met het sociaal monitoren wordt hier bedoelt het monitoren van de beleving/ervaringen van de verschillende partijen die betrokken zijn geweest bij de eilandkribben. De onderzoeksvragen die daarbij gebruikt zijn, hebben eraan bijgedragen om de doelstelling te volbrengen. Uiteindelijk zijn er drie aspecten van het monitoren behandeld in dit rapport. Voor elke van die aspecten is vervolgens een methode voor het monitoren opgesteld: - Methode voor het uitvoeren van een belevingsonderzoek in de toekomst en het monitoren van die beleving - Methode voor het monitoren van de bodemverandering als gevolg van de aanleg van de eilandkribben - Methode voor het monitoren van de toename van flora en fauna als gevolg van de aanleg van de eilandkribben},

abstract = {Abstract Riverbank migration has historically been seen as a risk to infrastructure that can be combated through channelization, bank stabilization, and sediment trapping. The physical processes involved with riverbank erosion and deposition are well defined, yet the solutions to equations that describe these processes are computationally and data intensive over large domains. While current understanding of large-scale river channel mobility largely comes from reach- and watershed-scale observations, we need global observations of riverbank erosion and accretion to broaden our understanding of sediment processes within and across river basins. In this work, we create the first global data set of riverbank erosion for >370,000 km of large rivers using up to 20 years of water classifications from Landsat imagery. We estimate uncertainty by propagating water classification errors through our methods. Globally, we find riverbank erosion for rivers wider than 150 m to have an approximately log-normal distribution with a median value of 1.52 m/yr. Comparing our data set to 25 similar estimates of riverbank migration, we found a normalized mean absolute error of 42\% and a bias of 5.8\%. We show that river width is the best first-order predictor of riverbank erosion, in agreement with existing literature. We also show that the relationship between width and bank erosion is substantially different among a sample of global river basins and suggest that this is due to second-order influences of geology, hydrology, and human influence. These data will help improve models of sediment transport, support models of bank erosion, and improve our understanding of human modification of rivers.},

ABSTRACT = {The objective of this study was to assess the performance of form-based and process-based models, and of local-scale and reach-scale models, used to examine bank retreat and sediment transport in stream restoration. The evaluated models were the Bank Erosion Hazard Index (BEHI), Bank Assessment for Nonpoint Source Consequences of Sediment (BANCS), Bank Stability and Toe Erosion Model (BSTEM), and HEC River Analysis System (HEC-RAS 1D). Model-to-model assessments were conducted to quantify the impact of model selection when predicting applied stress and geomorphic change in a restored stream in North Carolina, USA. Results indicated that the mobility of the bed dictated model selection at the reach-scale. The process-based HEC-RAS 1D was needed to accurately analyze the sand-bed stream, predicting amounts of geomorphic change comparable to measured data and up to three orders of magnitude higher than those from local-scale models. At the local-scale, results indicated that the bank retreat mechanism and flow variability constrained model selection. The form-based BEHI and BANCS did not directly account for geotechnical failure nor capture severe floods, underpredicting amounts of geomorphic change by an order of magnitude when compared to the process-based BSTEM, and failing to characterize erosion potential and applied stresses after short-term morphodynamic adjustments.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Human intervention makes river channels adjust their slope and bed surface grain size as they transition to a new equilibrium state in response to engineering measures. Climate change alters the river controls through hydrograph changes and sea level rise. We assess how channel response to climate change compares to channel response to human intervention over this century (2000–2100), focusing on a 300-km reach of the Rhine River. We set up a schematized numerical model representative of the current (1990–2020), non-graded state of the river, and subject it to scenarios for the hydrograph, sediment flux, and sea level rise. We conclude that the lower Rhine River will continue to adjust to past channelization measures in 2100 through channel bed incision. This response slows down as the river approaches its new equilibrium state. Channel response to climate change is dominated by hydrograph changes, which increasingly enhance incision, rather than sea level rise.},

abstract = {Abstract A bifurcation in an engineered river system (i.e., fixed planform and width) has fewer degrees of freedom in its response to interventions and natural changes than a natural bifurcation system. Our objective is to provide insight into how a bifurcation in an engineered river responds to peak flows and human interventions. To this end, we analyze the change in hydraulics, bed level, and bed surface grain size in the region of two bifurcations in the upper Rhine delta in the Netherlands over the last century. We show that, over the last two decades, the water discharge in one bifurcate (the Waal branch) has steadily increased at the expense of the other. This gradual increase in the water discharge of the first branch is associated with its erosion rate being larger than the other branch. The quick succession of two or three peak flow events (1993, 1995, and 1998) caused rapid sediment deposition over the upstream part of the bifurcate that has gradually lost discharge, which seems to have triggered the slow change in flow partitioning.},

abstract = {Abstract Existing tidal input reduction approaches applied in accelerated morphodynamic simulations aim to capture the dominant tidal forces in a single or double representative tidal cycle, often referred to as a “morphological tide.” These strongly simplified tidal signals fail to represent the tidal extremes and hence poorly allow to represent hydrodynamics in the intertidal areas. Here, a generic method is developed to construct a synthetic spring-neap tidal cycle that (a) represents the original signal; (b) is exactly periodic; and (c) is derived directly from tidal time series or harmonic constituents. The starting point is a fortnightly modulation of the semidiurnal tide to represent spring-neap variations, while conserving periodicity. Diurnal tides and higher harmonics of the semidiurnal tide are included to represent the asymmetry of the tide. The amplitudes and phases of the synthetic signal are then fitted to histograms of water levels and water level gradients derived from the original sea surface elevation time series. A depth-averaged model of the Ems estuary (The Netherlands) demonstrates the effects of alternative tidal input reduction techniques. Adopting the new approach, the along-estuary variation in tidal wave shape is well-represented, leading to an improved representation of extreme tidal conditions.

abstract = {In a small part of the Meuse, the only gravel bed river in the Netherlands, bed load transport cannot be measured from a measuring vessel because of the large flow velocities at flood discharges. Since 1994 these measurements were carried out from bridges by means of a truck with a winch. The first measurements were carried out with a Helley-Smith sampler and since 1997 the BTMA-2 sampler was used. The measurements of the bed load transport at the flood discharge of 2770 m3/s proved these measurements could be carried out for the entire range of discharges (Fig. 1). On top of both samplers an underwater camera was attached by which pictures of the river bed and the inflowing bed load were taken and stored on a video tape. The combination of the measurements with pictures of the river bed give an explanation of the complex morphological behaviour of the Common Meuse at varying discharges due to the building of an armour layer. The latest measurements of the bed load transport (1998) show the timeshift between maximum discharge and maximum bed load transport as shown earlier in laboratory experiments (Klaassen, 1987).},

  abstract     = {Claude Inglis, who died on 29 August 1974 at the age of 91 years, made his mark in India and later in Britain in the field of irrigation and hydraulic research. He was responsible for advances in irrigation management in the Bombay Deccan and made notable contributions on river training and the use of hydraulic models with loose boundaries. A key to his career and achievements lay in his character. K. K. Framji who succeeded Sir Claude as Director of Indian Waterways Experiment Station, Poona, recalls him as: ‘A man of strong character and honesty of purpose, and one indefatigable in his pursuits which reflected unlimited reserves of energy. He expected of his associates no more and no less than what he demonstrated by his own example. He was impatient to achieve progress in his mission of determining rational approaches to hydrodynamic problems and he spared neither himself nor his associates in the work for the benefit of India. It is said that scarcely anyone walked into his room without saying a prayer, but scarcely anyone came out of his room without the happy realization that he had learnt something worth while. He was a good judge of men and all the select research workers whom he fostered have grown to be men of stature in the field. His parting advice at the time of his retirement is characteristic of his own practice throughout his career: “Don’t hide mistakes and be absolutely honest with yourself in your work ....” ’},

  abstract     = {In this study the numerical model Delft3D is implemented on high-resolution grids to evaluate beach morphological response to groins and submerged breakwaters under sea-breeze conditions. The numerical model is compared with field measurements from three sites on the northern Yucatan coast of Mexico. At these sites, relatively low energy waves with significant wave heights arrive at a steep oblique angle to the coast that drives high sediment transport rates. After calibration of the model, by adjustment of model free parameters, the model results show accurate representations of the diurnal variation of hydrodynamic conditions (wave height and current velocity) driven by the daily sea-breezes. Moreover, the morphodynamic model shows a good representation of the rapid morphological changes, particularly of the accretion pattern caused by a temporary groin and the subsequent recovery following the structure removal. However, erosion patterns at the downdrift areas of structures were not reproduced, owing to the numerical model limitations of simulating swash morphodynamics. Model validation with field observations of the beach response behind submerged breakwaters enabled the model to be used for a parametric study. Following previous work, new equations are developed in the present study that show an improvement for predicting shoreline changes near submerged breakwaters under sea-breeze conditions. Despite the limitations in reproducing downdrift erosion, overall the high-resolution modelling approach satisfactorily simulates the hydrodynamic and the updrift accretion responses to coastal structures on sandy beaches with oblique waves.},

abstract = {The complex Ginzburg-Landau equation in one spatial dimension with periodic boundary conditions is studied from the viewpoint of effective low-dimensional behaviour by three distinct methods. Linear stability analysis of a class of exact solutions establishes lower bounds on the dimension of the universal, or global, attractor and the Fourier spanning dimension, defined as the number of Fourier modes required to span the universal attractor. The authors use concepts from the theory of inertial manifolds to determine rigorous upper bounds on the Fourier spanning dimension, which also establishes the finite dimensionality of the universal attractor. Upper bounds on the dimension of the attractor itself are obtained by bounding (or, for some parameter values, computing exactly) the Lyapunov dimension and invoking a recent theorem that asserts that the Lyapunov dimension, defined by the Kaplan-Yorke formula with the universal (global) Lyapunov exponents, is an upper bound on the Hausdorff dimension. This study of low dimensionality in the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation allows for an examination of the current techniques used in the rigorous investigation of finite-dimensional behaviour. Contact is made with some recent results for fluid turbulence models, and the authors discuss some unexplored directions in the area of low-dimensional behaviour in the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation.},

The developed non-coupled algorithm interacts among hydrodynamic, sediment, and morphology modules which are based on depth-averaged Navier-Stokes equations for the flow, the three-dimensional equation of conservation of sediment, and the mass balance between the bed and sediment (Exner equation) to simulate the reservoir sedimentation process. The non-coupled algorithm solves both the short-term scale and the relatively long-term scale problems of reservoir sedimentation. The proposed algorithm is verified using field data and by comparison with other accurate algorithms. Based upon the results of this investigation, the developed algorithm can be used to simulate long-term reservoir sedimentation while considerably decreasing the computational costs and preserving computational accuracy. The computational cost of the non-coupled algorithm is about 97% less than the conventional semi-coupled approach whereas the errors (Root Mean Square Error, Average Relative Error, and Maximum Relative Error of bed level) of the developed algorithm are approximately 15% greater than those for the semi-coupled algorithm for the average value.},

The developed multi-block sigma-coordinate can represent a steep slope topography smoothly with different numbers of horizontal layers, without producing any truncation error and artificial flux (PGFE). The multi-block sigma–coordinate can easily increase the depth-direction resolution of the sediment transport module in the sub-regions, without the aggregation of computational points in the shallow areas which may be caused by using high resolution over the entire domain. The model is beneficial for long-term simulation of morphological evaluations in lakes where the bed slope near delta region (the sedimentary area which forms where a river enters a lake/ocean) is mostly steep, and delta keeps advancing down the lake. The multi-block sigma approach at the block interface, where the number of horizontal layers varies, allocates the flux to the neighboring cells according to two essential factors, namely “the common border length” and “satisfying continuity” which lead to defining the virtual cells. A series of numerical tests have been performed. Comparison between the numerical results, the analytical solutions, and the experimental data demonstrated an appreciable accuracy, a satisfactory performance and the efficiency of this scheme.},

An example of such a boundary is the flexible leaflet of a human heart valve. It is the main achievement of the present paper that a method for solving the Navier-Stokes equations on a rectangular domain can now be applied to a problem involving this type of immersed boundary. This is accomplished by replacing the boundary by a field of force which is defined on the mesh points of the rectangular domain and which is calculated from the configuration of the boundary. In order to link the representations of the boundary and fluid, since boundary points and mesh points need not coincide, a semi-discrete analog of the δ function is introduced. Because the boundary forces are of order h−1, and because they are sensitive to small changes in boundary configuration, they tend to produce numerical instability. This difficulty is overcome by an implicit method for calculating the boundary forces, a method which takes into account the displacements that will be produced by the boundary forces themselves. The numerical scheme is applied to the two-dimensional simulation of flow around the natural mitral valve.},

  abstract     = {This paper is an overview of the finite element methods developed by the Team for Advanced Flow Simulation and Modeling (T*AFSM) [http://www.mems.rice.edu/TAFSM/] for computation of flow problems with moving boundaries and interfaces. This class of problems include those with free surfaces, two-fluid interfaces, fluid-object and fluid-structure interactions, and moving mechanical components. The methods developed can be classified into two main categories. The interface-tracking methods are based on the Deforming-Spatial-Domain/Stabilized Space-Time (DSD/SST) formulation, where the mesh moves to track the interface, with special attention paid to reducing the frequency of remeshing. The interface-capturing methods, typically used for free-surface and two-fluid flows, are based on the stabilized formulation, over non-moving meshes, of both the flow equations and the advection equation governing the time-evolution of an interface function marking the location of the interface. In this category, when it becomes neccessary to increase the accuracy in representing the interface beyond the accuracy provided by the existing mesh resolution around the interface, the Enhanced-Discretization Interface-Capturing Technique (EDICT) can be used to to accomplish that goal. In development of these two classes of methods, we had to keep in mind the requirement that the methods need to be applicable to 3D problems with complex geometries and that the associated large-scale computations need to be carried out on parallel computing platforms. Therefore our parallel implementations of these methods are based on unstructured grids and on both the distributed and shared memory parallel computing approaches. In addition to these two main classes of methods, a number of other ideas and methods have been developed to increase the scope and accuracy of these two classes of methods. The review of all these methods in our presentation here is supplemented by a number numerical examples from parallel computation of complex, 3D flow problems.},

abstract = {This article considers how aquatic systems modelling has changed since 1995 and how it must change in future if we are to continue to advance. A distinction is made between mechanistic and statistical models, and the relative merits of each are considered. The question of “when do aquatic systems models provide accurate and useful predictions?” is addressed, implying some guidelines for model development. It is proposed that, in general, ecological models only provide management-relevant predictions of the behaviour of real systems when there are strong physical (as opposed to chemical or ecological) drivers. Developments over the past 15 years have included changes in technology, changes in the modelling community and changes in the context in which modelling is conducted: the implications of each are briefly discussed. Current trends include increased uptake of best practice guidelines, increasing integration of models, operationalisation, data assimilation, development of improved tools for skill assessment, and application of models to new management questions and in new social contexts. Deeper merging of statistical and mechanistic modelling approaches through such techniques as Bayesian Melding, Bayesian Hierarchical Modelling and surrogate modelling is identified as a key emerging area. Finally, it is suggested that there is a need to systematically identify areas in which our current models are inadequate. We do not yet know for which categories of problems well-implemented aquatic systems models can (or cannot) be expected to accurately predict observational data and system behaviour. This can be addressed through better modelling and publishing practices.},

  title =    {Streamlining river groynes: Laboratory experiments in schematised geometry under submerged flow conditions},
  school =   {Delft University of Technology},
  year =     {2023},
  abstract = {Groynes are hydraulic structures commonly applied in the Dutch rivers. Depending on the water depth, groynes can be emerged or submerged. When a groyne is emerged, it has two main functions: maintaining the water depth in the main channel and preventing the river from eroding its bank. When the discharge in the river increases, the groynes become submerged. A submerged groyne acts as an obstacle to the flow, resulting in additional resistance and an increase in the upstream water level. To increase the flow capacity of a river during extreme conditions, a couple of measures can be considered: increasing the height of the dikes and embankments, reducing the overall resistance of the river cross- section and increasing the area of a river cross-section. This thesis focuses on reducing the overall resistance of the river cross-section, and more specifically, on investigating the effect that streamlining the downstream slope of a groyne has on the groyne-induced re- sistance. Hypothetically, streamlining the groyne by decreasing its downstream slope would decrease the intensity of flow processes like downstream flow separation, which could increase the discharge capacity of the groyne, and thus of the river cross-section, as a result of the decrease in groyne-induced resistance. An increase in discharge capacity would decrease the flood risk during extreme conditions. To investigate the effect of streamlining a groyne by decreasing its downstream slope, a physical model experiment was set up in the 5 × 40 m2 flume at the Hydraulic Engineering Laboratory of Delft University of Technology. The physical model represents part of a river cross-section. From the total 5 m width, the main channel and groyne field both took up 2 m and the floodplain took up 1 m. In streamwise direction, the flume contained six groynes and five full groyne fields. The groyne fields had transverse bed slope of 1:25. Electromagnetic flow meters (EMF meters) were used to measure the flow velocity at many points in both streamwise and transverse direction. The water level was measured by laser altimeters. Decreasing the downstream slope of a groyne to 1:8 compared to a reference situation with a downstream slope of 1:3 resulted in a 4 % increase of the discharge capacity over the crest of the groyne. This increase of discharge capacity was not uniform over the transverse axis. Near the groyne tip, this increase of discharge capacity was more than 6 %, whereas at the end of the groyne, the discharge capacity decreased slightly compared to the reference situation. A more detailed analysis of the data gave insight in why decreasing the downstream slope of a groyne in- creases the discharge capacity of a groyne. Streamlining the groynes resulted in a significant decrease of the relative turbulence intensity along the downstream slope of the groyne. This was consistently around 50 % lower for the streamlined groynes compared to the reference situation, indicating less intense turbulent structures. Moreover, auto-correlation functions of the flow velocity signals showed a shorter correlation length in conjunction with lower amplitudes and smaller periods of the fluctuations for the streamlined groynes. This indicates a signal with less correlation and higher frequencies. These results explain why the discharge capacity of a streamlined groyne is larger than of a reference groyne.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional hydrodynamic models are computationally expensive. This drawback can limit their application to solving problems requiring real-time predictions or several simulation runs. Although the literature presented improvements in using Deep Learning as an alternative to hydrodynamic models, Artificial Neural Networks applications for flood prediction cannot satisfactorily predict floods for areas outside the training datasets with different boundary conditions. In this paper, we used a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) aiming to generalize flood predictions in catchments not included in the training process. The proposed method, called cGAN-Flood, uses two cGAN models to solve a rain-on-grid problem by first identifying wet cells and then estimating the water depths. The cGANs were trained using HEC-RAS outputs as ground truth. cGAN-Flood distributes a target flood volume (vt) in a given catchment, which can be calculated via water balance from hydrological simulations. Our approach was trained on ten and tested on five urban catchments with distinct characteristics. The cGAN-Flood was compared to HEC-RAS for different rainfall magnitudes and surface roughness. We also compared our approach to the Weighted Cellular Automata 2D (WCA2D), a rapid flood model (RFM) used for rain-on-grid simulations. Our method successfully predicted water depths in the testing areas, showing that cGAN-Flood could generalize to different locations. However, cGAN-Flood tended to underestimate depths in channels in some areas for events with a small peak of precipitation intensity. cGAN-Flood was 50 and 250 times faster than WCA2D and HEC-RAS, respectively. Due to its computational efficiency and accuracy, we suggest that cGAN-Flood can be applied when fast simulations are necessary, and it can be a viable modeling solution for flood forecasts in large-scale watersheds.},

abstract = {It is challenging to model granular particles with arbitrary shapes and related complications to fluid–particle interactions for granular flows which are widely encountered in nature and engineering. This paper presents an improved framework of the immersed boundary method (IBM)-based fully resolved computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and discrete element method (DEM), with an emphasis on irregular-shaped particles and the implications to particle–fluid interactions. The improved CFD-DEM framework is featured by two novel enhancements with signed distance field (SDF). First, an SDF-based formulation is employed to enable handling of granular particles with arbitrary shapes in DEM robustly and efficiently. Second, the IBM is modified to be consistent with SDF to fully resolve fluid–particle interactions in the presence of non-spherical particles. Such treatments leverage SDF as a generic interface to furnish a new SDF-CFD-DEM framework for universal modeling of arbitrarily shaped particles interacting with multiphase fluids with desired resolutions. Exemplified particle shape models include super-quadrics, spherical harmonics, polyhedron and level set, and new shape models can be flexibly developed by implementing the unified SDF-based shape interface. The proposed SDF-CFD-DEM is validated and showcased with examples including particle settling, drafting–kissing–tumbling, immersed granular collapse, and mudflow. The results demonstrate the good accuracy and robustness of the SDF-CFD-DEM and its potential for efficient computational modeling of multiphase granular flows involving granular particles with arbitrary shapes.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a conceptual framework for erosion of cohesive sediment beds. We focus on cohesive beds, distinguishing between floc erosion, surface erosion, and mass erosion. By (our) definition, surface erosion is a drained soil mechanical process, whereas mass erosion occurs under undrained conditions. The eroding shear stress is modeled through a probability density function. This yields a continuous description of floc erosion and surface erosion as a function of mean bed shear stress. Furthermore, we assume a distribution for the bed strength. The mean values of the bed strength are derived from soil mechanical theory, assuming that the surface erosion rate is limited by the swelling rate from the undrained shear strength in the bed to its drained value at its surface. The rate of erosion then relates to the undrained shear strength of the soil, and its consolidation (swelling) coefficient. The critical shear stress for erosion is slightly larger than the true cohesion of the bed, i.e., the drained strength, and follows a power law relation with the plasticity index. The conceptual framework proposed herein has been validated against a limited number of experimental data, and has a series of advantages above other methods of direct measuring erodibility, as it is inexpensive and can be used to attain space-covering information on the sediment bed. Moreover, the use of bulk soil mechanical parameters accounts implicitly for the effects of organic material, though the role of, e.g., macrophytobenthos mats and/or bioturbation is difficult to capture a priori.},

abstract = {‘Wetlands’ in tidal lagoons and estuaries are among the most valuable ecosystems in the world. Managing these systems requires both a thorough knowledge and validated tools to predict their behavior and development. An important morpho-dynamic process herein is the erosion (‘pick-up’) of the bed, which are in inter-tidal areas often composed of a mixture of sand and mud. Aim of the study was the derivation and calibration of a generic formulation for surface erosion of sand-mud mixtures based on a geotechnical approach. Determining parameters for geotechnical and morphological behavior of sand-mud mixtures have been identified, and a surface erosion formulation is derived and validated. The agreement between calculated and measured erosion values indicates that the physically-derived formulation is an important alternative to present empirical formulations. This is particularly important for applying the formulation for the numerical modeling of the behavior of estuaries and lagoons. Furthermore, two new measuring techniques are developed which enable the in-situ characterization of sedimentological and soil mechanical properties. This data can be used to characterize and compare inter-tidal sediments properties, and to serve as input for the erosion formulation and/or for numerical simulations. Finally, an experimental strategy is presented for the collection of field data which are required to characterize the behavior of sand-mud mixtures.},

  abstract = {Experiments have been carried out in a mobile-bed laboratory flume in order to study the sediment exchange process between the main channel and the groyne fields. The flume represented half the width of a schematized river reach with a series of groynes. The experiment was designed to represent typical dimensions of the Dutch River Waal at a geometrical scale of 1:100. The conditions were set to guarantee bed load as well as suspended load sediment transport. Conditions with submerged and emerged groynes were investigated. In addition to traditional measurements, viz., bed-level changes, suspended sediment concentrations, and flow velocities, bed-form propagation was measured in two dimensions using a the particle image velocimetry technique. The results were analyzed with focus on sediment exchange mechanisms and sediment transport patterns. The results demonstrate that under all flow conditions there is a net import of sediment into the groyne fields. The prevailing transport mechanisms vary with the flow stage: if the groynes are emerged it is mainly advection by the primary circulation cell, whereas if the groynes are submerged it is rather residual advection by large-scale coherent flow structures (in a straight reach). Additional entrainment of sediment by enhanced turbulence complicates the erosion/deposition patterns.},

abstract = {A new unstructured grid, finite volume ocean model, H2Ocean, is described, that is suitable for flooding and drying problems. Here we derive the finite volume analogue of the P1NC-P1 finite element, by interpreting the advective term in the continuity equation in a flux sense. A corresponding non-overlapping control volume is then selected for the momentum equation. The resulting model employs the median node-dual control volume for the water elevations, and edge-wise control volume for the velocities. In contrast to the P1NC-P1 approach, the finite volume model not only guarantees mass conservation in a global sense, but it also explicitly guarantees mass conservation in each individual cell. Another feature of this new model is its ability to conserve momentum locally, and by applying a correction factor it can preserve constant energy head along a streamline in the case of rapidly varied flows. By using the upwind water depths in the flux computations, no special flooding and drying procedures need to be implemented. The new model is efficient, does not produce non-physical negative water depths and generates accurate results for a wide variety of flooding and drying problems. Compared with the results obtained from the P1NC-P1 finite element model, the new model produces better solutions in the simulation of inundations and in capturing shock waves.},

See email Mart Borsboom to Victor Chavarrias 2306191236: A potential complication with the TRITON exponentially varying artificial porosity is its non-smoothness at z = z_b + Deps. This causes in drying-flooding areas variations in the value of zeta – z_b at subsequent grid points of up to about Dx*tan(alpha), with Dx grid size and alpha bed slope. It is probably for this reason that setting Deps = Dx*tan(alpha) was found to work quite well, cf. halfway page 8 of runup-report_200509.pdf. I have investigated ways to get around that non-smoothness in the Maple worksheet porouslayerforms_analysis (pdf enclosed). See in particular the 3 figures in that worksheet: artificial porosity as a function of normalized depth, (effective) normalized water depth as a function of normalized surface elevation, and normalized wave celerity squared as a function of normalized surface elevation, all presented for a number of artificial porosity formulations.},

The horizontal density variation and the bottom evolution are incorporated into a fully nonlinear Boussinesq equation including vorticity effects. By coupling the flow equation with the depth-integrated sediment transport equation, morphodynamic simulation is made possible. A fourth-order finite volume method with an approximate Riemann solver is used to solve the governing equations. For the hydrodynamic test under strong wave–current interaction environment, the accuracy of the computed velocity and water surface was verified. For the three typical morphological benchmark tests, such as tsunami, regular wave and dam break flow, good agreement was obtained when proper parameters were provided. Therefore, the proposed morphodynamic model can be a useful tool for a wide range of shallow and wavy flows under dispersive and nonhydrostatic environments associated with wave, current, and sediment interaction.},

We found this out some years ago in some “uitzoekwerk” for the Veluwerandmeren project of Menno Genseberger. It has been written down in section 4.3 of the attached report. There, we found that the conservative formulation (also depending on the local water depth h) of FM gives less water level setup than the non-conservative (and independent) formulation of WAQUA.  So when decreasing the viscosity, this difference becomes smaller. In fact, I expect that decreasing the viscosity has little effect on the water levels in FM, whereas it will decrease the water levels in WAQUA. Hence, the change in the difference between the two.},

The Strang operator splitting technique is employed to treat the dispersive terms separately, and it provides the ability to ignore the dispersive terms in specified regions, such as surf zones. Algorithms that can handle wetting–drying and detect wave breaking are presented. The numerical solution algorithms are validated with numerical experiments to demonstrate the ability of the algorithms to accurately resolve hydrodynamics of solitary and regular waves, and morphodynamic changes induced by such waves. The results indicate that the model has the potential to be used in studies of coastal morphodynamics driven by dispersive water waves, given that the hydrodynamic part resolves the water motion and dispersive wave effects with sufficient accuracy up to swash zones, and the morphodynamic model can capture the major features of bed erosion and deposition.},

A numerical solution algorithm for the model based on the second-order Strang operator splitting is presented. The model is partitioned into two parts, (1) the SHSM equations and (2) the dispersive correction part, which are discretized using discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods. This splitting technique provides a facility to select dynamically regions of a problem domain where the dispersive term is not applied, e.g. wave breaking regions where the dispersive wave model is no longer valid. Algorithms that can handle wetting–drying and detect wave breaking are provided and a number of numerical examples are presented to validate the developed numerical solution algorithm. The results of the simulations indicate that the model is capable of predicting sediment transport and bed morphodynamic processes correctly provided that the empirical models for the suspended and bed load transport are properly calibrated. Moreover, the developed model is able to accurately capture hydrodynamics and wave dispersion effects up to swash zones, and its application is justified for simulations where dispersive wave effects are prevalent.},

abstract = {Abstract Permafrost thaw is hypothesized to increase riverbank erosion rates, which threatens Arctic communities and infrastructure. However, existing erosion models have not been tested against controlled flume experiments with open-channel flow past an erodible, hydraulically rough permafrost bank. We conducted temperature-controlled flume experiments where turbulent water eroded laterally into riverbanks consisting of sand and pore ice. The experiments were designed to produce ablation-limited erosion such that any thawed sediment was quickly transported away from the bank. Bank erosion rates increased linearly with water temperature, decreased with pore ice content, and were insensitive to changes in bank temperature, consistent with theory. However, erosion rates were approximately a factor of three greater than expected. The heightened erosion rates were due to a greater coefficient of heat transfer from the turbulent water to the permafrost bank caused by bank grain roughness. A revised ablation-limited bank erosion model with a heat transfer coefficient that includes bank roughness matched our experimental results well. Results indicate that bank erosion along Arctic rivers can accelerate under scenarios of warming river water temperatures for cases where the cadence of bank erosion is set by pore-ice melting rather than sediment entrainment.},

  abstract = {Bank erosion plays an important role in the hydro-morphodynamics and evolution of natural rivers. Therefore, it is essential to have a reliable bank erosion model for accurate simulation of hydro-morphodynamic processes. We developed and successfully implemented a new, feasible bank erosion model in Delft3D software. The developed model considers physical bank erosion processes to a greater extent than previous models. Model performance was assessed by comparison with a previously reported experiment in a mobile-bed-and-bank laboratory open-channel bend flume. The results from our developed model were compared with those from the standard Delft3D and angle of repose bank erosion models. We showed that progressive lateral bank erosion as well as the corresponding hydro-morphodynamics of the channel were better predicted by the developed bank erosion model. The results of this study provide insight into bank erosion prediction with Delft3D, and they suggest that the developed model will improve the performance of the Delft3D model for short- and long-term hydro-morphodynamic simulation of natural meandering rivers.},

  abstract     = {<p> During the last decade, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and data volume have developed at an unprecedented pace, and it is now evident that many scientific disciplines will need to revise their work modes to become more data centric in order to make the most out of these developments. AI and machine learning offer great opportunities throughout the workflow of numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate services, and the science community is currently exploring how the new capabilities of AI and machine learning will change the future of Earth system science. First results show great potential.<br>However, the scope and speed of developments also generate challenges for weather and climate modelling centres such as ECMWF, in particular regarding the necessary know-how that needs to be established, the software and hardware infrastructure that needs to be developed, and the integration of machine learning and conventional tools within the prediction workflow. These challenges need to be addressed within a comparably short period of time to keep up with changing needs of the weather and climate modelling community and ECMWF’s Member and Co-operating States. This document therefore sets out a roadmap for the next ten years that identifies the challenges, provides potential solutions, and defines steps to channel the many distributed science and technology projects that study machine learning for weather and climate predictions into a coordinated effort. While the roadmap does not provide a scientific workplan for machine learning activities, due to the number and diversity of the application areas, it outlines the path towards more coordinated solutions for the challenges ahead, and to generate synergies between the different machine learning efforts.</p>},

These simulations were compared with experimental data gathered in a fairly large-scale facility. In general, very good agreement was found on the discharge capacity, in free-flow and submerged conditions, regardless of the turbulence model tested. A dimensionless approaching free surface profile, which was virtually independent of the relative upstream head, was obtained. Downstream of the weir, under subcritical flow conditions, the numerical flow depths agreed reasonably well with the corresponding experimental data.},

The governing equations of the flow are solved using Standard k-ε, Realizable k-ε, Modified k-ω and Reynolds Stress Model based on the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes Equations and by Large Eddy and Detached Eddy Simulations. ANSYS-Fluent package program is used for the numerical analysis of flow with the same experimental conditions. The free surface of the trapezoidal weir flow is computed by the volume of fluid method. The effect of the selected grid structure on the numerical results is examined by Grid Convergence Index. Moreover, two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) analyses of the trapezoidal weir flow are included to estimate the effects of side walls. Experimental results of the velocity field and free surface profiles are compared to the numerical results of 2D and 3D simulations for the validation purposes. From the comparisons it is concluded that the Reynolds Stress Model estimates the flow field more accurately compared with those of the other models used in the present study. Furthermore, the flow characteristics such as turbulence kinetic energy, energy spectrum and pressure distributions for different flow rates are presented. Lastly, the discharge coefficients for different flow-weir configurations are compared experimentally and numerically.},

This study presents results from large eddy simulations (LESs) for surface jets over a submerged weir. Turbulent surface jets were computed over the flat and deformed beds due to scour for the same approach flow. The mean flow and turbulent statistics are presented for both flat and deformed bed conditions. Turbulent flows with the scour hole show that the reattachment region starting from the edge of the weir is located further downstream compared to the flows without scour. Furthermore, due to the presence of the scour hole, both average kinetic energy (AKE) and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) increases and vertical gradient of the AKE become steeper compared to the flat bed case. This demonstrates that the capability of energy transfers from the AKE to the TKE increases by forming the scour hole on the flat bed.},

The flow structure is experimentally characterised by particle image velocimetry measurements in a laboratory flume and simulated using three-dimensional Large Eddy Simulations. Good agreement between experimental measurements and numerical results is obtained. The results show that the effect of the obstacles in the main channel is observed up to one obstacle length in the spanwise direction. The spacing between obstacles does not seem to have a large influence in the outer flow. The mean flow within the dead zone is characterised by a large recirculation region and several additional vortex systems. They are discussed in the paper, as well as the mean and root-mean-square wall shear-stresses.},

	title       = {Shear-Stress and Sediment Distribution in a Meander Bend},
	abstract    = {A one-meter wide, meandering flume with movable sand bed was utilized in these experiments. Uniform flow was established at discharges of 20, 35, and 50 l/sec. Velocities near the bed, the distribution of sediment in transport, bed geometry, and strength of secondary flow were determined at each discharge . Bed shear stress was assumed to be proportional to the square of the velocity near the bed. Bed shear stresses were also measured with a Preston Tube in a uniform 35 l/sec flow over a dune-free stabilized bed. The stabilized bed was molded to the geometry produced by the same flow over sand. The zone of maximum bed shear stress and maximum sediment discharge is on the point bar in the upstream part of the bend. It crosses the channel centerline in the middle or downstream part of the bend, and follows the concave or down-valley bank to the next point bar downstream. With increasing discharge, secondary currents increase in strength. Consequently the zone of maximum bed shear stress and sediment discharge remains closer to the inside bank across the point bar, and crosses the channel centerline somewhat lower in the bend. Secondary currents were also stronger in the 35 l/sec over the stabilized bed than in the same flow over sand, apparently because no dunes were present to break up secondary flow in the former. The zone of maximum bed shear stress was consequently closer to the inside bank in the stabilized-bed run. It appears that bed geometry is adjusted to provide, at each point on the bed, precisely the shear stress necessary to transport the sediment load supplied. For example the gradual decrease in depth along the down-valley side of the channel from the deep in one bend to the point bar in the next results in a continual acceleration of the flow, and hence in shear stresses here which are higher than average for the channel. For many combinations of discharge, sediment discharge, and sediment character, straight channels are unstable in nature, and the commonly observed meander geometry is stable. To understand why this meander geometry is stable, we consider how displacements from the stable geometry set up forces tending to restore that geometry, From work done to date, it is hypothesized that channel width, W, is determined by cohesiveness of bank materials. The radius of curvature of the bend, R, is then determined by the fact that separation occurs when R/W=<2.5. Measurements of bank shear stress in movable-bed channels with different meander geometries are needed next.},

In the late eighteenth century the Dutch overseer of the rivers, Christiaan Brunings, integrated hydraulic theory and meteorological practices, which enabled him to design a unique instrument for measuring river flow. The question is whether the unprecedented detail of measurements fits the putative empirical stance in the eighteenth century. The interactions between theory, instrument, measurement, and other knowledge practices are here assessed using experiences in similar measurement practices. I argue that Brunings had theoretical and embodied understanding of hydrodynamics, as he knew how to design an instrument for flow measurement of sufficient accuracy for his purpose in the sociopolitical context of river management.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, using the Cattaneo's relaxation approach, we reformulate the system of governing equations for the pollutant transport by shallow water flows over non-flat topography and anisotropic diffusion as hyperbolic balance laws with stiff source terms. The proposed relaxation system circumvents the infinite wave speed paradox which is inherent in standard advection–diffusion models. This turns out to give a larger stability range for the choice of the time step. Second, following a flux splitting approach, we derive a novel numerical method to discretise the resulting problem. In particular, we propose a new flux splitting and study the associated two systems of differential equations, called the “hydrodynamic” and the “relaxed diffusive” system, respectively. For the presented splitting we analyse the resulting two systems of differential equations and propose two discretisation schemes of the Godunov-type. These schemes are simple to implement, robust, accurate and fast when compared with existing methods. The resulting method is implemented on unstructured meshes and is systematically assessed for accuracy, robustness and efficiency on a carefully selected suite of test problems including non-flat topography and wetting and drying problems. Formal second order accuracy is assessed through convergence rates studies.},

abstract = {According to legend, a conversation that took place more than 70 years ago between Albert Einstein and his eldest son, Hans Albert Einstein, gives rise to the favorite anecdote of every scientist or engineer working in the field of sediment transport. During this conversation, Hans told his father of his intent to carry out research on the mechanics of sediment transport. Albert had done some work in this area, notably on hindered settling in sediment suspensions, and he advised his son not to pursue study in this field, as he felt sediment transport was so difficult that it was intractable. Like many good sons before him, Hans ignored this advice, and went on to be one of a handful of prominent scientists that shaped modern sediment-transport theory and practice.},

This hinders warning-systems, interactive planning tools and detailed forecasts. Our novel method computes flood hazard maps over three orders of magnitude faster than current state-of-the-art methods. It applies physically-based principles of steady-state flow to evade dynamic aspects of flood simulations. It estimates the relevant information for flood hazard, such as peak flow height, velocity and flood arrival time. Performance indicators show similar or exceeding accuracy compared to traditional flow models depending on the type of and data. In our tests, computation is reduced 1500 times. The method provides new perspective for the field of flood hazards, flood risk reduction through new types of early-warning systems, and user-interactive hazard assessment systems. As climate change is expected to aggravate flood hazard, the presented method can bring efficiency to flood simulation. The method is freely available at www.fastflood.org.},

  abstract     = {Meandering rivers are distinguished by their characteristic sinuosity, which is subject to modulation through channel cutoff, resulting in the formation of oxbow lakes within the abandoned meander loops. Throughout the evolutionary course of a river, these cutoffs establish a connection between the channel and floodplain systems, both crucial to maintaining the dynamic equilibrium of the river system. Nonetheless, the interactive dynamic between the channel and floodplain and its influence on the transient behavior of the channel’s morphodynamics during a cutoff event are frequently reduced to simplistic representations in computational models. This study introduces a comprehensive numerical model that elucidates the adaptive processes of bed and planform during and subsequent to the inception of cutoff and oxbow lakes. The model is assessed through its application to a laboratory scale cutoff, before being employed to a real-world meandering river, specifically the Ucayali River in Peru, in order to gain understanding into channel development and the intricate patterns of planform dynamics following cutoff events. The model is able to capture the main modes of planform migration, translation and expansion for the case of the bend in the Ucayali River. During the neck cutoff, the model simulates the progression of erosional and depositional waves traveling in upstream and downstream directions respectively, underscoring the importance of incorporating both hydrodynamic and morphodynamic factors in characterizing the river dynamics associated with meander cutoffs.},

Breaching of dikes or dams is another process where sediments are eroded under the influence of high flow velocities. The existing pick-up functions were developed for relative low values of bed shear stress and hence overestimate erosion. Conventional pick-up functions can be made suitable for dealing with high-velocity erosion by taking the permeability of the sediment into account. This can be achieved by modifying the critical Shields parameter. The procedure is demonstrated using the van Rijn pick-up function. The theory is compared with experiment, and agreement is found to be good.},

Water surface profiles were recorded as the weir submergence set and for various stages of submergence. Variations in modular limit and discharge reduction factors for the present weirs were studied. It was found that the modular limit varied with the ratio of the free-flow head to the total streamwise length of the weir. Characteristic length scales such as horizontal and vertical distances from the toe of the surface jump and the first wave trough to the downstream crest edge of the weir were measured to generalize different wave patterns. It was found that the toe of the surface jump moved toward the weir as the weir submerged and varied linearly with the submergence level, which is the ratio of tailwater to headwater depths. For weirs of finite-crest length with upstream and downstream ramps (i.e.,\&nbsp;embankment weirs), the toe of the surface jump moved toward the weir as the submergence level increased up to 0.7. For higher submergence levels, the trough of the surface wave moved toward the downstream and eventually washed away. Efficiency and performance of the present weirs were evaluated with their own free-flow conditions. Empirical formulations were developed to predict the discharge reduction factor with submergence level. The performance of triangular weirs in submerged-flow conditions was found to be better than that of corresponding sharp-crested weirs; weirs became more efficient as the ratio of the free-flow head and the total length of the weir increased.},

Experimental research was carried out to describe the flow conditions in front of a trapezoidal broad-crested side weir at low Froude numbers in the approach channel for various combinations of inflow and overflow discharges. Three side weir variants with different oblique angles were studied. Flow characteristics at the side weir were analyzed and assessed based on the results obtained from extensive measurements performed on a hydraulic model. The empirical relation between the coefficient of obliqueness, the angle of side weir obliqueness, and Froude numbers upstream and downstream of the weir was derived.},

  abstract     = {Laboratory experiments were carried out to investigate the water surface characteristics of submerged flow over sharp-crested weirs. Interesting observations were made on the water surface profiles near the weir as weir submergence sets in as well as for various stages of submergence. Submerged flow was divided into four regimes: (I) impinging jet, (II) surface jump, (III) surface wave, and (IV) surface jet. It was found that a surface jump turned into a surface wave when the wave trough became level with the tip of the weir. The surface jet regime began as the surface waves faded out. A condition was set to quantify the boundary between the surface wave and surface jet regimes. Based on flow observations, the surface jet regime sets in as the amplitude of the surface wave becomes small (i.e.,\&nbsp;less than 0.1h, where h is the head). An empirical equation was developed based on the literature data to predict the discharge reduction factor in the generally used discharge equation. This formulation was compared with other formulations in the literature. It was found that the proposed formulation provides a slightly better estimation of flow discharge.},

For finite crest length weirs, because the existing data sets are not extensive, new experiments for these weirs with sharp-edged and rounded crest were conducted. Based on these data, a diagram is developed to show the variation of the normalized tailwater depth with ho/L where ho is the free flow head and L is the length of the crest, to predict the onset of submergence or the modular limit. Water surface profiles of flow over weirs of finite crest length with square-edge and rounded crests were plotted to study the formation of waves in modular and submerged conditions. Characteristics length scales such as wave length and amplitude at the modularity limit and the location of the first trough downstream of the weir were measured to generalize surface profiles at different flow discharges. An empirical equation for the discharge reduction factor was also formulated. This equation has two exponents with different values for several classes of finite crest length weirs with either square edged or rounded crest.},

For a relative overflow depth between 10\% and 40\%, the surface profile, the bottom pressure profile, the boundary separation profile, and the velocity profiles close to the upper corner are self‐similar, provided effects of scale may be dropped. For extremely long‐crested weirs, undular flow occurs. The first wave profile is shown to be identical with the solitary wave profile. The main properties of the undular hydraulic jump are explored. The broad‐crested weir is characterized by insensitivity to tailwater submergence. The modular limit is found practically constant at 75\% of the tailwater level, independent of the relative head on the weir. The discharge‐head relation for submerged flow is analyzed under a novel approach. Finally, recommendations are specified under which a broad‐crested weir may be used as a discharge measurement structure.},

Using the broad-crested weir equation with a discharge coefficient as the basis and following the earlier studies of broad-crested weirs, robust correlations have been developed for the discharge coefficient by using the experimental results available in the literature. Effects of upstream and downstream ramps were studied by introducing the upstream and the downstream length scales, respectively. The proposed correlations of embankment weirs were compared with the head-discharge formulations of embankment weirs in the literature. Triangular (hump) weirs with either upstream or downstream ramps (or both) have also been considered. It was found that in triangular (hump) weirs, the discharge coefficient increases when the downstream slope increases, but it decreases when the upstream slope increases.},

Data are presented comparing the effect of slopes of  2H:1V  ,  1H:1V  and vertical in various combinations on the upstream and downstream faces of the weir. Pressure and surface profiles were self-similar for all cases tested. Increasing the upstream slope to the vertical decreased the height of the surface profile and, hence, the static pressure of the crest. It also reduced the discharge coefficient. The variation in downstream static pressures was negligible though. Varying the downstream slope had a negligible effect on the surface and pressure profiles over the weir. Changes in flow were constrained to the region downstream of the crest. Cavitation could occur at the downstream corner of the weir if the upstream head was sufficiently high and a sloped face was used. This paper presents data that will be of use in the design of hydraulic structures for flow control and measurement.},

  abstract     = {The manuscript presents the results of an aggradation experiment performed in a laboratory channel with supercritical flow. The channel was fed with a stationary sediment load exceeding the transport capacity of the flow in the initial condition, thus inducing sediment aggradation and an increase of the bed slope. The experiment is part of a laboratory campaign mimicking sediment overloading in mountain rivers, a process that can determine increased hydraulic risk levels at key spots. A crucial issue in measuring sediment aggradation is the definition and determination of the bed elevation, this issue being quite relevant in experiments with a relatively large transport capacity, where a thick bed-load layer exists and hinders the possibility to determine with confidence a reference bed elevation. The determination of the bed elevation, in turn, impacts the quantification of a number of properties, including the initial sediment transport capacity of the flow, temporal scales of the aggradation process, water depth and Froude number. The manuscript presents a sensitivity analysis of the results to two extreme definitions for the bed elevation: the first one locates the bed at the upper edge of the bed-load layer, while the second one at the lower edge of the bed-load layer where the particles do not move. The presentation of the two alternatives is focused on the experimental methods they use, consistently with the intent of the special issue. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the definition of the bed elevation also has a major impact on numerical models of the process. The experimental results have been reproduced numerically, demonstrating that the calibration parameters returning a best fit are also impacted significantly by how the bed is defined. The preferred definition for analyzing an experimental campaign is locating the bed below the bed-load layer.},

abstract = {Abstract The spatial and temporal variation of energy dissipation rates in breaking waves controls the mean circulation of the surf zone. As this circulation plays an important role in the morphodynamics of beaches, it is vital to develop better understanding of the energy dissipation processes in breaking and broken waves. In this paper, we present the first direct field measurements of roller geometry extracted from a LiDAR data set of broken waves to obtain new insights into wave energy dissipation in the inner surf zone. We use a roller model to show that most existing roller area formulations in the literature lead to considerable overestimation of the wave energy dissipation, which is found to be close to, but smaller than, the energy dissipation in a hydraulic jump of the same height. The role of the roller density is also investigated, and we propose that it should be incorporated into modified roller area formulations until better knowledge of the roller area and its link with the mean roller density is acquired. Finally, using previously published results from deepwater wave breaking studies, we propose a scaling law for energy dissipation in the inner surf zone, which achieves satisfactory results at both the time-averaged and wave-by-wave scales.},

One way to study the morphological changes, the time scale of these changes and the expected ecological rehabilitation is to study gravel bed rivers with approximately the same morphological characteristics as the future Grensmaas. Since scale models in nature of the future Grensmaas do not exist, selection criteria of reference rivers have to be modified. The results of the reference investigation will be different and the interpretation will be much more complicated. An important morphological parameter is the (yearly) sediment transport. A method to measure sediment transport during high discharges is described and tested.},

  abstract = {Abstract The stability of river channels and their suitability as habitat for aqueous organisms is strongly controlled by the rate of bedload transport. Quantification of bedload transport rates in rivers is difficult, not only because of the temporal variation in transport, but also because of the cross-channel variation in transport. The objectives of this study were: (i) to determine the effect of cross-channel variation in bedload transport on the uncertainty of width-integrated transport rates; and to use this knowledge (ii) to improve guidelines for bedload sampling. This was done through a thorough statistical evaluation of stochastic and systematic uncertainties involved in bed-load transport measurements. Based on this evaluation, new guidelines are presented for determination of the number of samples and sampling positions across the channel that are required for bedload measurements in several types of sand-bed rivers and gravel-bed rivers. The guidelines relate to bedload measurements made with pressure-difference (Helley-Smith type) samplers that require numerous bedload samples of short duration at several positions across the channel. The results show that generally more sampling positions across the channel are required in gravel-bed rivers than in sand-bed rivers. For gravel-bed rivers with unknown cross-channel distribution of transport, at least 10 sampling positions are recommended, whereas for most sand-bed rivers five positions suffice. In addition, at least 12 short-duration samples are required at each position to obtain bedload estimates with uncertainties below 20\%. If the same level of uncertainty is desired in the case of high spatial and temporal variation in transport rates, the number of short-duration samples needed per sampling position increases to 40.},

abstract = {In recent years, coastal management has been facing new challenges: socio-economic growth and consequent climate change impose new boundary conditions pushing coastal systems towards unseen states. For adaptation and mitigation strategies as well as risk management, the resilience of systems to these projected changes must be tested and quantified using predictive tools, given the scarcity of observations. Process-based models, which limit the number of assumptions, are the preferred tools. However, these models are computationally expensive and therefore unattractive for global sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. Input and model reduction techniques, as well as behavioural empirical models, have been widely used to overcome these computational difficulties. In this paper, we propose a process-based hybrid workflow—that combines statistical and machine learning with a process-based numerical model—to provide sensitivity analyses on complex systems. As an example we explore salt intrusion in estuaries. The novelty of the method presented is the implementation of an adaptive sampling technique of numerical experiments with a process-based hydrodynamic model, and the training of a neural network to augment the set of numerical runs executed. The first uses predictive uncertainty to automatically explore the response of the complex system to varying environmental boundary conditions and geomorphological configurations. The second is trained to provide system responses around the sampled points. This exploration is closed by simulating the extremes in the output space as found by a genetic algorithm. This scheme is shown to be highly efficient in non-linear, heteroscedastic, and highly non-stationary systems.},

  abstract = {Measurement of near-bed sediment velocities with acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) is an emerging approach for quantifying bed-load sediment fluxes in rivers. Previous investigations of the technique have relied on conventional physical bed-load sampling to provide reference transport information with which to validate the ADCP measurements. However, physical samples are subject to substantial errors, especially under field conditions in which surrogate methods are most needed. Comparisons between ADCP bed velocity measurements with bed-load transport rates estimated from bed-form migration rates in the lower Missouri River show a strong correlation between the two surrogate measures over a wide range of mild to moderately intense sediment transporting conditions. The correlation between the ADCP measurements and physical bed-load samples is comparatively poor, suggesting that physical bed-load sampling is ineffective for ground-truthing alternative techniques in large sand-bed rivers. Bed velocities measured in this study became more variable with increasing bed-form wavelength at higher shear stresses. Under these conditions, bed-form dimensions greatly exceed the region of the bed ensonified by the ADCP, and the magnitude of the acoustic measurements depends on instrument location with respect to bed-form crests and troughs. Alternative algorithms for estimating bed-load transport from paired longitudinal profiles of bed topography were evaluated. An algorithm based on the routing of local erosion and deposition volumes that eliminates the need to identify individual bed forms was found to give results similar to those of more conventional dune-tracking methods. This method is particularly useful in cases where complex bed-form morphology makes delineation of individual bed forms difficult.},

Initially, the model skill decreases for a few decades. Against common perception, the model skill increases after that to become excellent after 110 years. We attribute this to the self-organization of the morphological system which is reproduced correctly by the numerical model. On time scales exceeding decades, the interaction between the major tidal forcing and the confinement of the estuary overrules other uncertainties. Both measured and modeled bathymetries reflect a trend of decreasing energy dissipation, less morphodynamic activity, and thus a more stable morphology over time, albeit that the estuarine adaptation time is long (approximately centuries). Process-based models applied in confined environments and under constant forcing conditions may perform well especially on long (greater than decades) time scales.},

  abstract = {Bed load samples from four locations in the Trinity River of northern California are analyzed to evaluate the performance of the Wilcock-Crowe bed load transport equations for predicting fractional bed load transport rates. Bed surface particles become smaller and the fraction of sand on the bed increases with distance downstream from Lewiston Dam. The dimensionless reference shear stress for the mean bed particle size (τ*rm) is largest near the dam, but varies relatively little between the more downstream locations. The relation between τ*rm and the reference shear stresses for other size fractions is constant across all locations. Total bed load transport rates predicted with the Wilcock-Crowe equations are within a factor of 2 of sampled transport rates for 68\% of all samples. The Wilcock-Crowe equations nonetheless consistently under-predict the transport of particles larger than 128 mm, frequently by more than an order of magnitude. Accurate prediction of the transport rates of the largest particles is important for models in which the evolution of the surface grain size distribution determines subsequent bed load transport rates. Values of τ*rm estimated from bed load samples are up to 50\% larger than those predicted with the Wilcock-Crowe equations, and sampled bed load transport approximates equal mobility across a wider range of grain sizes than is implied by the equations. Modifications to the Wilcock-Crowe equation for determining τ*rm and the hiding function used to scale τ*rm to other grain size fractions are proposed to achieve the best fit to observed bed load transport in the Trinity River.},

Because these are used in hydraulic and environmental studies, their capability to simulate flow dynamics properly is critical to guarantee infrastructure and human safety. Although validating these codes is an important issue, code validations are currently restricted because analytic solutions to the shallow water equations are rare and have been published on an individual basis over a period of more than five decades. This article aims at making analytic solutions to the shallow water equations easily available to code developers and users. It compiles a significant number of analytic solutions to the shallow water equations that are currently scattered through the literature of various scientific disciplines. The analytic solutions are described in a unified formalism to make a consistent set of test cases. These analytic solutions encompass a wide variety of flow conditions (supercritical, subcritical, shock, etc.), in one or two space dimensions, with or without rain and soil friction, for transitory flow or steady state. The corresponding source codes are made available to the community (http://www.univ-orleans.fr/mapmo/soft/SWASHES), so that users of shallow water-based models can easily find an adaptable benchmark library to validate their numerical methods.

  abstract     = {Despite great progress in simulating multiphysics problems using the numerical discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs), one still cannot seamlessly incorporate noisy data into existing algorithms, mesh generation remains complex, and high-dimensional problems governed by parameterized PDEs cannot be tackled. Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-time domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-based regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-dimensional problems.},

By solving the one-dimensional Burgers equation and the two-dimensional heat-conduction equation, the precision and effectiveness of the proposed method have been proven. Numerical results indicate that this DNN-based technique is capable of obtaining an error of less than 10-7. Moreover, its computation time is less sensitive to the problem size than that of classic iterative methods. Consequently, the proposed method possesses a significant efficiency advantage for large-scale problems.},

It investigated a complicated system of nonlinear equations, in order to find out enough about the properties of the solutions of these equations that insight can be obtained into the various patterns exhibited by the field and that data can be derived concerning the relative frequencies of these patterns in the hope that in this way a basis may be found for the calculation of important values. The difficulties encounter are of a twofold nature: in part they are connected with the complicated geometrical character of the hydrodynamical equations; in part they are dependent upon the presence of nonlinear terms, containing derivatives of the first order of the velocity components, along with derivatives of the second order multiplied by the very small coefficient of viscosity. The latter feature is responsible for a number of important, characteristics of turbulence, among which are prominent those connected with the balance of energy and with the appearance of dissipation layers. These layer an important part in the energy exchange, as they represent the main regions where energy is dissipated.},

Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction–diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.},

  abstract     = {Abstract We describe a novel framework for estimating subsurface properties, such as rock permeability and porosity, from time-lapse observed seismic data by coupling full-waveform inversion (FWI), subsurface flow processes, and rock physics models. For the inverse modeling, we handle the back propagation of gradients by an intrusive automatic differentiation strategy that offers three levels of user control: (1) At the wave physics level, we adopted the discrete adjoint method in order to use our existing high-performance FWI code; (2) at the rock physics level, we used built-in automatic differentiation operators from the TensorFlow backend; (3) at the flow physics level, we implemented customized partial differential equation (PDE) operators for the multiphase flow equations. The three-level coupled inversion strategy strikes a good balance between computational efficiency and programming efforts, and when the gradients are chained together, it constitutes a coupled inverse system. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the three-level coupled inverse problem is superior in terms of accuracy to a traditional decoupled inversion strategy. Additionally, our method is able to simultaneously invert for parameters in empirical relationships such as the rock physics models. Our proposed inverted model can be used for reservoir performance prediction and reservoir management/optimization purposes.},

  abstract     = {Abstract We present a physics-informed deep neural network (DNN) method for estimating hydraulic conductivity in saturated and unsaturated flows governed by Darcy's law. For saturated flow, we approximate hydraulic conductivity and head with two DNNs and use Darcy's law in addition to measurements of hydraulic conductivity and head to train these DNNs. For unsaturated flow, we approximate unsaturated conductivity function and capillary pressure with DNNs and train these DNNs using measurements of capillary pressure and the Richards equation. Because it is difficult to measure unsaturated conductivity in the field, we assume that no measurements of unsaturated conductivity are available. The proposed approach enforces the partial differential equation (PDE) (Darcy or Richards equation) constraints by minimizing the PDE residual at select points in the simulation domain. We demonstrate that physics constraints increase the accuracy of DNN approximations of sparsely observed functions and allow for training DNNs when no direct measurements of the functions of interest are available. For the saturated conductivity estimation problem, we show that the physics-informed DNN method is more accurate than the state-of-the-art maximum a posteriori probability method. For the unsaturated flow in homogeneous porous media, we find that the proposed method can accurately estimate the pressure-conductivity relationship based on the capillary pressure measurements only, even in the presence of measurement noise.},

  abstract     = {We propose a conservative physics-informed neural network (cPINN) on discrete domains for nonlinear conservation laws. Here, the term discrete domain represents the discrete sub-domains obtained after division of the computational domain, where PINN is applied and the conservation property of cPINN is obtained by enforcing the flux continuity in the strong form along the sub-domain interfaces. In case of hyperbolic conservation laws, the convective flux contributes at the interfaces, whereas in case of viscous conservation laws, both convective and diffusive fluxes contribute. Apart from the flux continuity condition, an average solution (given by two different neural networks) is also enforced at the common interface between two sub-domains. One can also employ a deep neural network in the domain, where the solution may have complex structure, whereas a shallow neural network can be used in the sub-domains with relatively simple and smooth solutions. Another advantage of the proposed method is the additional freedom it gives in terms of the choice of optimization algorithm and the various training parameters like residual points, activation function, width and depth of the network etc. Various forms of errors involved in cPINN such as optimization, generalization and approximation errors and their sources are discussed briefly. In cPINN, locally adaptive activation functions are used, hence training the model faster compared to its fixed counterparts. Both, forward and inverse problems are solved using the proposed method. Various test cases ranging from scalar nonlinear conservation laws like Burgers, Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) equations to systems of conservation laws, like compressible Euler equations are solved. The lid-driven cavity test case governed by incompressible Navier–Stokes equation is also solved and the results are compared against a benchmark solution. The proposed method enjoys the property of domain decomposition with separate neural networks in each sub-domain, and it efficiently lends itself to parallelized computation, where each sub-domain can be assigned to a different computational node.},

Flow can be experimentally visualized using, for example, smoke or contrast agents, but extracting velocity and pressure fields from this information is tricky. Raissi et al. developed a machine-learning approach to tackle this problem. Their method exploits the knowledge of Navier-Stokes equations, which govern the dynamics of fluid flow in many scientifically relevant situations. The authors illustrate their approach using examples such as blood flow in an aneurysm. Science, this issue p. 1026 A machine learning approach exploiting the knowledge of Navier-Stokes equations can extract detailed fluid flow information. For centuries, flow visualization has been the art of making fluid motion visible in physical and biological systems. Although such flow patterns can be, in principle, described by the Navier-Stokes equations, extracting the velocity and pressure fields directly from the images is challenging. We addressed this problem by developing hidden fluid mechanics (HFM), a physics-informed deep-learning framework capable of encoding the Navier-Stokes equations into the neural networks while being agnostic to the geometry or the initial and boundary conditions. We demonstrate HFM for several physical and biomedical problems by extracting quantitative information for which direct measurements may not be possible. HFM is robust to low resolution and substantial noise in the observation data, which is important for potential applications.},

In this Bayesian framework, the Bayesian neural network (BNN) combined with a PINN for PDEs serves as the prior while the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) or the variational inference (VI) could serve as an estimator of the posterior. B-PINNs make use of both physical laws and scattered noisy measurements to provide predictions and quantify the aleatoric uncertainty arising from the noisy data in the Bayesian framework. Compared with PINNs, in addition to uncertainty quantification, B-PINNs obtain more accurate predictions in scenarios with large noise due to their capability of avoiding overfitting. We conduct a systematic comparison between the two different approaches for the B-PINNs posterior estimation (i.e., HMC or VI), along with dropout used for quantifying uncertainty in deep neural networks. Our experiments show that HMC is more suitable than VI with mean field Gaussian approximation for the B-PINNs posterior estimation, while dropout employed in PINNs can hardly provide accurate predictions with reasonable uncertainty. Finally, we replace the BNN in the prior with a truncated Karhunen-Loève (KL) expansion combined with HMC or a deep normalizing flow (DNF) model as posterior estimators. The KL is as accurate as BNN and much faster but this framework cannot be easily extended to high-dimensional problems unlike the BNN based framework.},

By instead adopting a least squares space-time control volume scheme, we obtain a scheme which more naturally handles: regularity requirements, imposition of boundary conditions, entropy compatibility, and conservation, substantially reducing requisite hyperparameters in the process. Additionally, connections to classical finite volume methods allows application of inductive biases toward entropy solutions and total variation diminishing properties. For inverse problems in shock hydrodynamics, we propose inductive biases for discovering thermodynamically consistent equations of state that guarantee hyperbolicity. This framework therefore provides a means of discovering continuum shock models from molecular simulations of rarefied gases and metals. The output of the learning process provides a data-driven equation of state which may be incorporated into traditional shock hydrodynamics codes.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Bank vegetation plays a key role in both hydrodynamics and morphodynamics of natural rivers; however, these effects are often unaccounted for in the computational flow dynamics of natural waterways. Recent studies using the large-eddy simulation (LES), however, have attempted to gain insights into the impacts of bank vegetation on the mean flow field of the natural rivers using a vegetation model, which applies a sink term to the momentum equations of motion. This approach accounts for the effects of the vegetation and provides a practical approach to account for the complex patches of bank vegetation in large-scale rivers. To implement the vegetation model, a drag coefficient reflecting the overall resistance of vegetal structures to the flow is needed, but due to the lack of calibrated data and range of size, density and type of vegetation, this parameter can be a significant source of uncertainty in the model results. In this study, we use uncertainty quantification (UQ) to investigate the hydrodynamics and bed shear results when a bank vegetation is incorporated in an LES model. To this end, we used the polynomial chaos expansion and Monte Carlo sampling techniques to determine the uncertainties associated with the drag coefficient in the vegetation model and from uncertainties in the bed roughness and inflow discharge. The UQ analysis provided spatially varying confidence levels for the spanwise and vertical distribution of velocity magnitude and for the bed shear stress distributions. In addition, Sobol indices were computed to indicate the relative influence that each parameter had on the overall uncertainty. In general, it was found that uncertainty in flow discharge was the dominant source of uncertainty; however, the drag coefficient in the vegetation model and the bed roughness parameter also made significant contribution to the uncertainty near the banks and bed, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Sustainable river management often requires long-term morphological simulations. As the future is unknown, uncertainty needs to be accounted for, which may require probabilistic simulations covering a large parameter domain. Even for one-dimensional models, simulation times can be long. One of the acceleration strategies is simplification of models by neglecting terms in the governing hydrodynamic equations. Examples are the quasi-steady model and the diffusive wave model, both widely used by scientists and practitioners. Here, we establish under which conditions these simplified models are accurate. Based on results of linear stability analyses of the St. Venant-Exner equations, we assess migration celerities and damping of infinitesimal, but long riverbed perturbations. We did this for the full dynamic model, that is, no terms neglected, as well as for the simplified models. The accuracy of the simplified models was obtained from comparison between the characteristics of the riverbed perturbations for simplified models and the full dynamic model. We executed a spatial-mode and a temporal-mode linear analysis and compared the results with numerical modeling results for the full dynamic and simplified models, for very small and large bed waves. The numerical results match best with the temporal-mode linear analysis. We show that the quasi-steady model is highly accurate for Froude numbers up to 0.7, probably even for long river reaches with large flood wave damping. Although the diffusive wave model accurately predicts flood wave migration and damping, key morphological metrics deviate more than 5\% (10\%) from the full dynamic model when Froude numbers exceed 0.2 (0.3).},

  abstract = {Despite creating one of Earth's most iconic landforms, and having been studied since antiquity, river meandering is currently explained by several alternative models that remain debated. This is partly because observers have deconstructed meanders to a set of properties thought to be fundamental or significant for meandering, but each of these underpinning properties is itself complex and in turn requires analysis of its causes and mechanisms. This philosophical contribution aims to provide a perspective on the state of the science that makes a rigorous interrogation into what ‘causation’ actually means, and explores what a systems perspective can elucidate about meandering phenomena. We approach the problem through a discussion of the variety of ways in which previous researchers have tackled the problem of meandering, from a channel and floodplain perspective, on Earth and Mars, in the field and laboratory, and at the present day through to the ancient stratigraphic record. It is evident that river meandering has numerous causal pathways rather than a single set of necessary and sufficient conditions. A systemic view on the evolution of plant species shows that their feedbacks on river pattern likewise have several pathways. Employing the conceptual apparatus of the philosophy of science will move us towards a more consensual synthesis of river meandering.},

  abstract     = {We extend and analyze the deep neural network multigrid solver (DNN-MG) for the Navier–Stokes equations in three dimensions. The idea of the method is to augment a finite element simulation on coarse grids with fine scale information obtained using deep neural networks. The neural network operates locally on small patches of grid elements. The local approach proves to be highly efficient, since the network can be kept (relatively) small and since it can be applied in parallel on all grid patches. However, the main advantage of the local approach is the inherent generalizability of the method. Since the network only processes data of small sub-areas, it never “sees” the global problem and thus does not learn false biases. We describe the method with a focus on the interplay between the finite element method and deep neural networks. Further, we demonstrate with numerical examples the excellent efficiency of the hybrid approach, which allows us to achieve very high accuracy with a coarse grid and thus reduce the computation time by orders of magnitude.},

  abstract     = {We present the deep neural network multigrid solver (DNN-MG) that we develop for the instationary Navier-Stokes equations. DNN-MG improves computational efficiency using a judicious combination of a geometric multigrid solver and a recurrent neural network with memory. DNN-MG uses the multi-grid method to classically solve on coarse levels while the neural network corrects interpolated solutions on fine ones, thus avoiding the increasingly expensive computations that would have to be performed there. This results in a reduction in computation time through DNN-MG's highly compact neural network. The compactness results from its design for local patches and the available coarse multigrid solutions that provides a “guide” for the corrections. A compact neural network with a small number of parameters also reduces training time and data. Furthermore, the network's locality facilitates generalizability and allows one to use DNN-MG trained on one mesh domain also on different ones. We demonstrate the efficacy of DNN-MG for variations of the 2D laminar flow around an obstacle. For these, our method significantly improves the solutions as well as lift and drag functionals while requiring only about half the computation time of a full multigrid solution. We also show that DNN-MG trained for the configuration with one obstacle can be generalized to other time dependent problems that can be solved efficiently using a geometric multigrid method.},

  abstract     = {Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are neural networks (NNs) that encode model equations, like Partial Differential Equations (PDE), as a component of the neural network itself. PINNs are nowadays used to solve PDEs, fractional equations, integral-differential equations, and stochastic PDEs. This novel methodology has arisen as a multi-task learning framework in which a NN must fit observed data while reducing a PDE residual. This article provides a comprehensive review of the literature on PINNs: while the primary goal of the study was to characterize these networks and their related advantages and disadvantages. The review also attempts to incorporate publications on a broader range of collocation-based physics informed neural networks, which stars form the vanilla PINN, as well as many other variants, such as physics-constrained neural networks (PCNN), variational hp-VPINN, and conservative PINN (CPINN). The study indicates that most research has focused on customizing the PINN through different activation functions, gradient optimization techniques, neural network structures, and loss function structures. Despite the wide range of applications for which PINNs have been used, by demonstrating their ability to be more feasible in some contexts than classical numerical techniques like Finite Element Method (FEM), advancements are still possible, most notably theoretical issues that remain unresolved.},

abstract = {Abstract The EU Nature Restoration Law represents an important opportunity for freshwater habitat restoration and, consequently, freshwater biodiversity protection. However, a number of challenges must be anticipated in its implementation, which may compromise its success. Some aspects, particularly those relating to freshwater ecosystems, require more clarification. We use riverine ecosystems to illustrate existing ambiguities in the proposed legislation and the potential consequences of leaving these aspects open to interpretation during the implementation process. We also discuss potential solutions to these problems which could help ensure that the law's objectives are met. We argue that river network structure and connectivity dimensions, which result into river meta-ecosystems, must be explicitly considered. For that purpose, we ask for clear definitions of the critical terms “free-flowing rivers,” “barriers,” and “reference areas.” In addition, we recommend developing methods for integrated assessment of connectivity across river networks. As a key property of river ecosystems, this must be used to prioritize actions to increase the length and number of free-flowing rivers. Adequate restoration planning at larger spatial scales will benefit from a meta-ecosystem perspective and accurate representation of aquatic-terrestrial linkages, which will significantly improve the efficacy of restoration efforts. Furthermore, stakeholder and citizen engagement offer important opportunities at local, national, and European scales, and should be fostered to ensure inclusive decision-making. The conservation challenges outlined here are particularly important for rivers, but they also have implications for other ecosystems. These considerations are useful for policymakers, conservationists, and other stakeholders involved in the Nature Restoration Law and related policy initiatives.

This application of harmonic analysis &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;and &amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;the introduction of formal statistical testing appear both to be new in this field.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The method is tested on six locations in the Dutch North Sea, all with continuous sea level records of at least 130 years. The results of the statistical quality tests are shown in this paper.

Long-period cycles with periods equal to the oceanic perigean and nodal tide are found to be important for a correct interpretation of sea level over time. Statistical tests show that acceleration of the rate of sea level is not significant up to 2021; the last year in the dataset.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I compare my results with contemporary projections of sea level rise. The comparison reveals that in the Dutch North Sea the projected rates of rise are a factor two or more higher than the empirical rates established in this paper.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},

A synopsis of their theoretical basis is given, and the assumptions commonly pertaining to their use are described. These models, which can be applied more efficiently than many other process-oriented models, are categorized, and the kind of information that they can provide is also described.

abstract = {Sand waves are found on shallow, sandy seabeds throughout the world and their dynamics may pose an imminent threat to offshore construction. Therefore, there is a pressing need to understand bed level dynamics in sand wave areas. These bed level dynamics lead to variations in sand wave shape and migration rate over time. However, these variations cannot be explained with the present-day process-based sand wave models, which all include a purely periodic tidal forcing. To explain these fluctuations a more intricate description of the hydrodynamics is necessary. The aim of this study is to explore the importance of time-varying, non-tidal currents for sand wave dynamics in the North Sea. We adopted the three-dimensional Delft3D-Flexible Mesh model, and were able to reconstruct time-varying, non-tidal currents on top of the periodic tidal forcing, while significantly reducing computation times. The simulated currents and water levels showed a good agreement with in-situ measurements. Compared to the situation with only tidal forcing, the simulated sedimentation and erosion rates were amplified up to 15 times due to time-varying, non-tidal currents. Additionally, periods of net erosion were found at locations in the sand wave transect where tidally forced models only showed net-sedimentation. It is therefore important to consider time-varying, non-tidal currents when predicting future sand wave dynamics in the field.},}

  abstract     = {Recent progress in the improvement of numerical stability and accuracy of the Yee and Sjögreen [49] high order nonlinear filter schemes is described. The Yee & Sjögreen adaptive nonlinear filter method consists of a high order non-dissipative spatial base scheme and a nonlinear filter step. The nonlinear filter step consists of a flow sensor and the dissipative portion of a high resolution nonlinear high order shock-capturing method to guide the application of the shock-capturing dissipation where needed. The nonlinear filter idea was first initiated by Yee et al. [54] using an artificial compression method (ACM) of Harten [12] as the flow sensor. The nonlinear filter step was developed to replace high order linear filters so that the same scheme can be used for long time integration of direct numerical simulations (DNS) and large eddy simulations (LES) for both shock-free turbulence and turbulence-shock waves interactions. The improvement includes four major new developments: (a) Smart flow sensors were developed to replace the global ACM flow sensor [21,22,50]. The smart flow sensor provides the locations and the estimated strength of the necessary numerical dissipation needed at these locations and leaves the rest of the flow field free of shock-capturing dissipation. (b) Skew-symmetric splittings were developed for compressible gas dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations [35,36] to improve numerical stability for long time integration. (c) High order entropy stable numerical fluxes were developed as the spatial base schemes for both the compressible gas dynamics and MHD [37,38]. (d) Several dispersion relation-preserving (DRP) central spatial schemes were included as spatial base schemes in the framework of our nonlinear filter method approach [40]. With these new scheme constructions the nonlinear filter schemes are applicable to a wider class of accurate and stable DNS and LES applications, including forced turbulence simulations where the time evolution of flows might start with low speed shock-free turbulence and develop into supersonic speeds with shocks. Representative test cases for both smooth flows and problems containing discontinuities for compressible flows are included.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Deltaic channel networks are important conduits for water and material supplies to the fluvial and coastal communities. However, increasing human interventions in river deltas have altered the topology and geometry of channel networks as well as their long-term evolution. While the morphological evolution of a single channel has received extensive studies, the system-wide morphological responses of channel networks to local disturbances remain largely unclear. Here we investigate the morphological responses of a bifurcating channel network subject to local disturbance of channel deepening due to dredging and sand mining through idealized simulations, and further compare the results with the reference scenarios of a single channel and theoretical analysis of the phase plane. The results show that the infilling of the local deepening is associated with the erosion of the entire branch, which also causes system-wide effects on the siltation of the other branch. The morphological responses of the bifurcating channel network consist of a relatively short stage for the infilling of the local deepening followed by a relatively long stage for recovering the equilibrium configuration of the river bifurcation. The system-wide effects of the local disturbance arise from the altered water surface slope and water partitioning downstream of the bifurcation due to the local deepening. Also, the prolonged recovery of the equilibrium configuration is consistent with theoretical analysis, which reveals a slow evolution of the bifurcation when approaching the equilibrium. Our results can help understand the long-term morphological responses of large-scale complex channel networks and inform water managements under increasing human interventions.},

  abstract     = {Rivers can abruptly shift pathways in rare events called avulsions, which cause devastating floods. The controls on avulsion locations are poorly understood as a result of sparse data on such features. We analyzed nearly 50 years of satellite imagery and documented 113 avulsions across the globe that indicate three distinct controls on avulsion location. Avulsions on fans coincide with valley-confinement change, whereas avulsions on deltas are primarily clustered within the backwater zone, indicating a control by spatial flow deceleration or acceleration during floods. However, 38\% of avulsions on deltas occurred upstream of backwater effects. These events occurred in steep, sediment-rich rivers in tropical and desert environments. Our results indicate that avulsion location on deltas is set by the upstream extent of flood-driven erosion, which is typically limited to the backwater zone but can extend far upstream in steep, sediment-laden rivers. Our findings elucidate how avulsion hazards might respond to land use and climate change. River avulsions are places where a river abandons its channel, and they are a common feature of geomorphological structures such as deltas. Brooke et al. used 50 years of satellite images to look at the location and change in river avulsions globally (see the Perspective by Passalacqua and Moodie) and found that avulsions are often tied to changes in channel slope or sedimentation just upstream of the river. However, in some cases, the river avulsion is farther upstream than expected, likely due to erosional processes. Understanding what controls avulsion location in the context of climate and land use changes is vital because avulsions are strongly tied to risks from flooding. —BG Global satellite observations reveal topographic and climatic controls on river avulsions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Erosion-control measures in rivers aim to provide sufficient navigation width, reduce local erosion, or to protect neighboring communities from flooding. These measures are typically devised to solve a local problem. However, local channel modifications trigger a large-scale channel response in the form of migrating bed level and sediment sorting waves. Our objective is to investigate the large-scale channel response to such measures. We consider the lower Rhine River from Bonn (Germany) to Gorinchem (the Netherlands), where numerous erosion-control measures have been implemented since the 1980s. We analyze measured bed level data (1999–2020) around four erosion-control measures, comprising scour filling, bendway weirs, and two fixed beds. To get further insight on the physics behind the observed behavior, we set up an idealized one-dimensional numerical model. Finally, we study how the geometry and spacing of the measures affect channel response. We show that erosion-control measures reduce the sediment flux due to (a) lack of erosion over the measure and (b) sediment trapping upstream of the measure, resulting in downstream-migrating incision waves that travel tens of kilometers at decadal timescales. When the measures are in close proximity, their downstream effects may be amplified. We conclude that, despite fulfilling erosion-control goals at the local scale, erosion-control measures may worsen large-scale channel-bed incision.},

  abstract     = {At a channel (reach) scale, braided channels are fluvial, geomorphological, complex systems that are characterized by a shift of bars during flood events. In such events water flows are channeled in multiple and mobile channels across a gravel floodplain that remain in unmodified conditions. From a geometrical point of view, braided patterns of the active hydraulic channels are characterized by multicursal nature with structures that are spatially developed by either simple- and multi-scaling behavior. Since current studies do not take into account a general procedure concerning scale measurements, the latter behavior is still not well understood. The aim of our investigation is to analyze directly, through a general procedure, the scaling behavior of hydraulically active channels per transect and per reach analyzed. Our generalized stochastic approach is based on Taylor’s law, and the theory of exponential dispersion distributions. In particular, we make use of a power law, based on the variance and mean of the active channel fluctuations. In this way we demonstrate that the number of such fluctuations with respect to the unicursal behavior of the braided rivers, follows a jump-process of Poisson and compound Poisson-Gamma distributions. Furthermore, a correlation is also provided between the scaling fractal exponents obtained by Taylor’s law and the Hurst exponents.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Local river interventions, such as channel narrowing or side channels, are often necessary to maintain safety, ecology, or navigation. Such interventions have different effects on the river's bed morphology during periods of high- and low-discharge events. Mapping the bed-level variations for different discharge levels and understanding these effects can provide new opportunities for the design of interventions in multifunctional rivers. At any moment, the local bed level in a river is composed of bed-level changes that occur at various spatial and temporal scales. These changes consist of bed aggradation/degradation trends on a large scale, on an intermediate scale bed-level variations as a result of discharge fluctuations, and on small-scale moving river bed forms like dunes. Using the river Waal in the Netherlands as a case study, we analyze the intermediate-term bed-level changes resulting from discharge fluctuations (dynamic component) and propose adaptations to the design of floodplain interventions such that possible negative impact on the local bed-level changes is minimized. Time series of bed levels along two 10 km stretches of the case study are considered for a period of 16 years (2005–2020). Using a wavelet transform, we isolate bed-level variations resulting from discharge events. These bed-level variations are presented based on the magnitude of the discharge event and are compiled in an interactive atlas of river morphodynamics, allowing us to mitigate the impact of interventions. This will help river managers in the design of interventions and lead to improved management, operation, and maintenance of multifunctional rivers.},

Many of the significant results which have been obtained by pursuing this kind of analysis are reviewed in this paper by using as an illustration a family of implicit approximations of the simple linear advection equation. Included in this family of algorithms are the common six-point implicit finite difference scheme, the linear finite element/Galerkin scheme and the ‘box’ method. The phase and group velocities of sinusoidal solutions are brought into the analysis of the accuracy and of the spurious reflection or scattering phenomena which are created at computational boundaries and in non-uniform grids. General properties become apparent in this Fourier/wave propagation approach to the analysis. One of these is in the form of an analogy with quantum mechanics. Another shows that certain energy norms of the errors are independent of time discretization, i.e. depend on space discretization alone.},

First, we pre-process hydraulic parameters to optimize training speed without compromising accuracy, achieving a 91.67\% acceleration compared with traditional methods. To address the vanishing gradient problem, layer normalization is also incorporated into the architecture. We also introduce novel physical constraints—water level range and junction node equations—to ensure effective training convergence and enrich the model with additional physical insights. Two practical case studies using HEC-RAS benchmarks demonstrate that our improved PINN method can predict river network hydrodynamics with less data and is less sensitive to time step size, allowing for longer computational time steps. Incorporating physical knowledge, our enhanced PINN methodology emerges as an efficient and promising avenue for modelling the complexities of hydrodynamic processes in natural river networks.},

  abstract = {In this book, which focuses on the use of iterative methods for solving large sparse systems of linear equations, templates are introduced to meet the needs of both the traditional user and the high-performance specialist. Templates, a description of a general algorithm rather than the executable object or source code more commonly found in a conventional software library, offer whatever degree of customization the user may desire.  Templates offer three distinct advantages: they are general and reusable; they are not language specific; and they exploit the expertise of both the numerical analyst, who creates a template reflecting in-depth knowledge of a specific numerical technique, and the computational scientist, who then provides “value-added” capability to the general template description, customizing it for specific needs.  For each template that is presented, the authors provide: a mathematical description of the flow of algorithm; discussion of convergence and stopping criteria to use in the iteration; suggestions for applying a method to special matrix types; advice for tuning the template; tips on parallel implementations; and hints as to when and why a method is useful.},

It is shown that Coriolis‐induced secondary currents should be of importance if they have a magnitude of 1\% of the downstream velocity. A simplified analysis is used to estimate the relative magnitude of the horizontal secondary velocity at the cross‐plane center point for fully developed flow in a wide channel as a function of Rossby number. Numerical model simulations are used to investigate the influence of the side walls and the magnitude of the secondary velocities for developing flow. The results show that the secondary velocities amount to about 1\% of the downstream velocity for rather slowly flowing deep channels.},
